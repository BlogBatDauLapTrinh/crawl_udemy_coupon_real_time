This is not a series of follow-along videos but rather a full set of instructions on how to do any exercise with perfect form</p><p><br></p><p>This Fat-Loss Training program is a carefully selected progression of fun exercises and workouts that are <strong>scientifically designed to build strength, muscle, and burn fat.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>There is <strong>no fluff or BS</strong> in this program. Workouts take between 20-45 minutes. Your first workouts will take less time and as you get more advanced, you will be adding a few extra sets and reps to each exercise.</p><p><br></p><p>This program is about building strength in order to preserve muscle mass as you lose fat. There are<strong> no jumping jacks or cardio exercises designed to make you sweat for the sake of sweating.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Instead, I provide a way for you to give the <strong>maximum stimulus to your muscles </strong>in order to <strong>optimize fat-loss, build strength, and tone your body.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A&nbsp;common problem you've likely run into before is that workouts and exercises are too advanced for you. This program is designed with the beginner in mind and <strong>requires Absolutely No Prior Knowledge or Experience</strong> with training.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You will learn exactly</strong> <strong>how and why you're doing every exercise</strong>. I hold your hand through the entire process by providing the workouts you need to do, when you need to do them, and how to do them in order to get the best results possible.</p><p><strong>Injury prevention</strong> along with actually <strong>enjoying your workouts</strong> are the keys to consistency. Doing High-Intensity style training often leads to injuries and hard-to-measure results. When you go from <strong>not being able to do a single push-up to cranking out 20+ reps in a row,</strong> you will stay motivated because you can feel the results of your hard work.</p><p>You've most likely bought courses and books in the past only to be disappointed with overpriced and lack luster results. That's why I created this course and put all of my heart and kinesiology knowledge into it so you can get the best results possible. </p><p>When I started training myself over 10 years ago, I was at home with almost no equipment.

He's spot on regarding messaging (refining the three points you need to make) and how to prepare on short notice. Between the training videos and the PDF books included in the course, it's invaluable -- and affordable for just about anyone. I took a media training course in NYC which required me to fly in for three entire weekends over the course of three consecutive months; TJ Walker covered essentially the same content right here. I've worked in radio/television as a producer/host and I've been interviewed by national media outlets from Good Morning America to the New York Times, so I'm picky; and I'm typically critical of those I see out there passing themselves off as media training experts, especially since I do media training (on a much smaller scale) myself. TJ Walker is the real deal. Though the production values aren't high end and the lighting/background could use some tweaking, the content itself is top-notch. Whether you have only two hours or up to two days before your interview, you'll have a significantly better chance of success by investing part of that time in taking this\" </em>Linda Lowen</p><p>***</p><p><em>''I faced a lot of tvs, Radio, and Phone interviews in recent months.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

I've studied TJ's methods for a long time and actually use his approach in my own media training work. His course videos are clear, to the point and candid about the realities of making a living as a media trainer.\"</em>&nbsp;Janet Vasil</p><p><em>\"5 Stars! Mr.Walker is so clear in his pitch and voice. He is so motivating and encouraging. I think I have found the right mentor after a long search.\"</em>&nbsp;Varsha Srivastava</p><p><em>\"5 Stars! He is a very good practitioner and he knows what he is talking about. He is also able to convey his message very well.\"</em>&nbsp;Harriston Ho</p><p><em>\"5 Stars! I'm learning from someone who has successfully worked with world-class clients... This is helping me move from what i think might work, into being confident in using techniques that have been proven over time!\"</em>&nbsp;Lori Wilson</p><p><em>\"5 Stars! I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\"&nbsp;</em>Nick Cisik</p><p><em>\"5 Stars! TJ Walker shows you what it takes to run a successful media training business. Fair warning: you might not want to run this business after taking the course. He'll show you what you must do to be a success. Hint: It's all about marketing. Great insights. If you decide to start a business, you'll start on the right foot with your eyes wide open. If you are looking to add media training to your PR business, you'll get great insights on how to run the training and give feedback.

So we\u2019re going to do a demo where I prove to you that using a Numpy vectorized operation is faster than using a Python list.</p><p>Then we\u2019ll look at some more complicated matrix operations, like products, inverses, determinants, and solving linear systems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why learn pandas?</strong><br></p><p>If you've spent time in a spreadsheet software like MS Excel or Google Sheets and want to take your data analysis skills to the next level, this course is for you! <br></p><p>Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with \u201crelational\u201d or \u201clabeled\u201d data both easy and intuitive.

So he is giving us an actual example of the very thing that he is talking about. His expressions and gestures are perfectly suited to the points he is making. And his pronunciation is very clear and easy to understand. Also his sentences are spoken with the emphasis in the right places. This course is designed for native speakers of English. The same basic principles could probably be applied in a course designed for non-native speakers. I would like to see such a course someday. I am really enjoying this course.

From Zero to Hero in a Couple of Days.</strong></p><p><strong>Setup your Google Search &amp; Display Campaign Today</strong></p><p>Google Ads are a great way to boost your brand profile, generate more leads and traffic, and gain more sales. The Google Ads platform focuses on Pay Per Click (PPC) ads, where advertisers pay per impression on an ad. PPC marketing is a tailorable, affordable form of web marketing, but to succeed, and not waste money, you must take the right approach. Typically it takes many years of experience to gain the in-depth knowledge necessary to get the most out of your PPC campaign.</p><p>With this Google Ads course, we aim to get you on the road to success faster, and as long as you are willing to put the work in, and apply our techniques and strategies, you'll be well equipped with everything you need to succeed. The strength of advertising with Google lies in its massive market reach and the ability it gives you to create highly targeted campaigns. With Google Ads you can drive quality traffic to your brand, garnered from people searching Google for products and services, similar to the ones you're offering.</p><p>To boost your reach, ads from Google often feature across other platforms, including YouTube, Blogger, and the Google Display Network. Another great feature of Google Ads is the Google Ads Analytics dashboard, which allows you to monitor the performance of your ads over time. This helps you hone the effectiveness of your Google Ads and adjust your content and target audience for a more optimal return on your investment. It's definitely worth investing in Google Ads, as even if you're ranking well organically, your results are likely to appear lower than those who have paid to promote. </p><p><strong>Write Google Ads Copy that People Love to Click On</strong></p><p>If you want maximum click throughs, you must use copywriting strategies that evoke strong emotion and are targeted to your ideal reader. The best type of Ad Copies are short and punchy, with enough impact to arouse curiosity, or provoke a reaction. Incorporating numbers is a great way to make Ad Copies sound more specific.</p><p><strong>Find &amp; Choose the Right Keywords</strong></p><p>Search for words or phrases related to your products or services. The keywords you choose are used to show your ads to people. Select high-quality, relevant keywords for your ad campaign to help you reach only the most interested people, who are more likely to become your customers.</p><p><strong>Optimise your Google Ads Targeting</strong></p><p>Targeting ads is an essential part of a successful advertising campaign. You may have designed the perfect ad, but you'll need to show it to the right people at the right time to better reach your goal. Google Ads offers different ways of targeting your ads.</p><p><strong>Learn New Keywords Matching Options</strong></p><p>Keywords are words or phrases that are used to match ads with the terms people are searching for. The keyword match types dictate how closely the keyword needs to match with the user\u2019s search query in order for the ad to be considered for the auction. So you could use broad match to serve your ad on a wider variety of user searches or you could use exact match to hone in on specific user searches.</p><p><strong>Use Efficiently Negative Keywords</strong></p><p>Negative keywords let you exclude search terms from your campaigns and help you focus on only the keywords that matter to your customers. Better targeting can put your ad in front of interested users and increase your return on investment (ROI).</p><p><strong>Understand everything about new search terms reports</strong></p><p>Use the search terms report to identify new search terms with high potential, and add them to your keyword list. Look for search terms that aren't as relevant to your business, and add them as negative keywords. This can help you avoid spending money showing your ad to people who aren't interested in it.</p><p><strong>Use Auction Insights to Compare Performance</strong></p><p>The auction insights report lets you compare your performance with other advertisers who are participating in the same auctions that you are. This information can help you make strategic decisions about bidding and budgeting by showing you where you're succeeding and where you may be missing opportunities for improved performance. The auction insights report is available for both Search and Shopping campaigns.</p><p><strong>Determine a Bid strategy Based on your Goals</strong></p><p>Google Ads offers several bid strategies that are tailored to different types of campaigns. Depending on which networks your campaign is targeting, and whether you want to focus on getting clicks, impressions, conversions, or views you can determine which strategy is best for you. In this article, we'll describe how to use your advertising goals to choose your bid strategy.</p><p><strong>Improve your Google PPC Quality Score</strong></p><p>Google uses your PPC Quality Score (QS) to decide how your ad should rank. The higher your quality score, the better your position will be. This score factors in how relevant your landing page and ads are to the keywords you've selected and also assesses your expected clickthrough rate.</p><p><strong>Make use of Ad Extensions</strong></p><p>Ad Extensions let you supplement your Google ad with one of five additional features for no extra cost. You can select from a Sitelink, Call button, Location info, or App download link, or can choose to showcase an Offer instead.</p><p><strong>Use the Power of Google Discovery Ads</strong></p><p>You can use Discovery campaigns to help reach up to 3 billion customers across Google feeds to achieve your performance goals in Google Ads. Thanks to Google's audience and customer intent signals, this campaign type helps you deliver highly visual, inspiring personalized ad experiences to people who are ready to discover and engage with your brand\u2014all through a single Google Ads campaign.</p><p><strong>Maxime your Efficiency with Google Max Performance Ads</strong></p><p>Performance Max is a new goal-based campaign type that allows performance advertisers to access all of their Google Ads inventory from a single campaign. It's designed to complement your keyword-based Search campaigns to help you find more converting customers across all of Google's channels like YouTube, Display, Search, Discover, Gmail, and Maps.</p><p>Performance Max helps you drive performance based on your specified conversion goals, delivering more conversions and value by optimizing performance in real-time and across channels using Smart Bidding. Performance Max combines Google's automation technologies across bidding, budget optimization, audiences, creatives, attribution, and more. They're all empowered by your specific advertising objective (for example, if you have a CPA or ROAS target) and the creative assets, audience signals, and optional data feeds you provide.</p><p><strong>Learn Google Ads Retargeting</strong></p><p>Retargeting is a way to connect with people who previously interacted with your website or mobile app. It allows you to strategically position your ads in front of these audiences as they browse Google or its partner websites, thus helping you increase your brand awareness or remind those audiences to make a purchase.</p><p><strong>Set up Google shopping (Google Merchant Centre)</strong></p><p>If you're a retailer, you can use Shopping campaigns to promote your online and local inventory, boost traffic to your website or local store, and find better qualified leads. To get started, you'll send us your product data with Merchant Center and create a campaign in Google Ads. Then, we'll use your campaign to create ads on Google and around the web where potential customers can see what you're selling. We call these placements Shopping ads because they appear in a different, more visual format. In contrast to a text ad, which displays text only, Shopping ads show users a photo of your product, plus a title, price, store name, and more. These ads give users a strong sense of the product you're selling before they click the ad, which gives you more qualified leads.</p><p><strong>Create Visual Performance Reports with Google Data Studio</strong></p><p>You can add Ad Manager as a data source in Data Studio to create data visualisation reports. The most popular Ad Manager report dimensions and metrics are available. These reports can be securely shared with others in your organisation or publicly.</p><p><strong>Learn how to Efficiently Setup YouTube Ads</strong></p><p>YouTube connects you to the people who matter most to your business. Turn viewers into customers, on any budget. YouTube Ads uses Google data to match your message to the right people at the right moment. YouTube Ads make it easy for people to choose your business. Get more purchases, subscribers, website visits, and more.

The nemesis of every deathly-dull presentation on earth can be employed in fun, fascinating, and highly reader-friendly ways.</p><p>Here's how.</p><p>First, you need to learn the following five \"basic\" elements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5 tips for better bullet points</strong></p><p>Readers adore bullets \u2014 they make your content less difficult to skim and pull out the vital facts, so it's positively digestible.</p><p><br></p><p>But don't just toss them into your copy\u2014 use them wisely and creatively. Here are five recommendations for well-done bullets:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>Good bullet points raise awareness of something that <strong>satisfies the reader</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points are <strong>proportional</strong>. It's best to keep them around the exact number of lines on the screen.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points are <strong>orderly</strong>. This isn't an overview for your high school English class \u2014 bypass subsections, sub-bullets, etc.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points are <strong>parallel</strong>. Begin each bullet with the same amount of speech \u2014 if one begins with a noun, don't make the following one a verb.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points (like headlines) <strong>aren't always whole sentences</strong> \u2026 but keep them compatible.</p></li></ol><p>And note \u2014 bullet points can be in a numbered list or in the form of \"unordered\" bullets. But both work perfectly fine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now for the excellent effects \u2026 fascinations.</strong></p><p>F<em>ascination is </em>an ancient copywriting word, signifying the mesmerizing elements or characteristics of a product (or service, or email newsletter, or ebook \u2026 you get the point) that can be teased out and used to draw your audience's attention to read further.</p><p>Fascinations are a particular kind of bullet point that is so exhilarating and benefit-driven that the reader just can't help but read more to discover the promised secret.</p><p><br></p><p>It's a fantastic strategy for:</p><ul><li><p>Luring readers back into the copy they skimmed</p></li><li><p>Provoking the download of a free book</p></li><li><p>Compelling someone to click on a link</p></li><li><p>Propelling subscriptions to your site or newsletter</p></li><li><p>Triggering the desired \"Add to Cart,\" click</p></li></ul><p>The key to a fascination is sagging the blessing teasingly without really giving away the \"Secret\".</p><p><br></p><p>Fascinations originate way back from traditional direct response copywriting. For instance, look at some copy from <em>Bottom Line Secrets</em>, a subscription periodical that promises insider data to make your life more comfortable. The business established itself many years ago with a sales article that was basically nothing but very captivating bullet points.</p><p>Here are some samples from that original ad:</p><ul><li><p>Why some patients are given favored status in hospitals \u2026 almost <em>preferred treatment</em>. This little-known information could save your life.</p></li><li><p>How to learn about medical discoveries <em>before</em> your doctor.</p></li><li><p>How and when blood pressure can fool you \u2026 and drinking alcohol <em>without</em> hangovers.</p></li><li><p>The two famous cold remedies that, taken together, can give you ulcers.</p></li><li><p>A simple way to prevent Montezuma's Revenge.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Do you see how perfectly these are combined together? They hint at a product's benefit without slopping the beans about how to get that gift. You need to subscribe if you want a simple way to prevent Montezuma's Revenge.</p><p><br></p><p>That's a fascination.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where do fascinations come from?</strong></p><p>The best way to discover stunning fascinations is to examine your product or service and determine what benefits you provide to your clients.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember to hold them favorably appropriate. Focus on the advantages that are most persuasive for your particular audience.</p><p><br></p><p>If at all feasible, use numerals and statistics. So \"How to reduce your blood pressure\" is good, but \"How to lower your blood pressure as much as 10 points \u2026 without medication\" is a lot more fascinating.</p><p><br></p><p>Attempt to discover an aspect of practical surprise as well. \"Learn to improve your flexibility\" is good, but \"Add 6 inches to your toe-touch in 10 minutes \u2026 even if you've never been able to touch the ground before\" is much more promising.</p><p><br></p><p>Put time and effort into creating your bullet points fascinating (or at least transparent and valuable), and customer response will increase.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4775504/preview/?startPreviewId=42413706", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3694744", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Gatsby JS | Build a personal blog using gatsbyJS", "content_length": "286", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Tech Vista", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "236", "students": "79206", "coupon_code": "NOV_2022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3694744_21f8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/gatsbyjs-graphql-build-a-personal-blog-using-gatsbyjs-graphql/?couponCode=NOV_2022", "expired_date": "2022-12-03 16:58:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "311", "headline": "Learn Gatsby JS and GraphQL to increase your knowledge in modern web development.", "description": "<p>Learn to build blazing fast apps and websites with React using Gatsby, a static PWA (Progressive Web App) generator!

I'd like to talk to you in more depth about this idea.\" Wouldn't it be great to know that you can entice anyone into wanting a meeting with you after just a 30 second conversation? Nothing will enhance your <strong>personal branding</strong> as much as the ability to communicate an elevator pitch in a concise and compelling manner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; \tIn this How to Deliver an Elevator Pitch course you will learn the following:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to craft a tight, focused elevator pitch&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to rehearse on video&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to appear confident and relaxed&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to make sure your message is interesting and memorable&nbsp; </p><p>*How to demonstrate excellent <strong>personal branding</strong></p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course is delivered primarily through spoken lectures. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards.

He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today's environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker's delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\"&nbsp;Debbie Tudor<br></p><p>What others say about the instructor:<br></p><p>\u201cTJ Walker's single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\" <em>Bob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television</em></p><p>\u201cTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\" <em>Stu Miller, Viacom News Producer</em></p><p>(TJ Walker's Media Training Worldwide) \u201cThe world's leading presentation and media training firm.\"<em>Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor</em></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/364026/preview/?startPreviewId=2290648", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4773334", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Influence", "title": "Secrets to Write a Copywriting that Sells like HOT Cakes!", "content_length": "104", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Passive Income Gen Z", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "65", "students": "14598", "coupon_code": "SECRETS-COPY", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4773334_7a3b_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/secrets-to-write-a-copy-that-sells-like-crazy-freelance-copy/?couponCode=SECRETS-COPY", "expired_date": "2022-11-30 07:41:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "46", "headline": "Master The 21 proven bullet SECRETS of the Most Persuasive People Without Manipulation In 21 Minutes A Day \u2026Guaranteed!", "description": "<p><strong>21 proven bullet SECRETS revealed by the best writers in the business</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Bullet Secrets That FUEL The Selling Authority of Your Copy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Use the world's most potent BULLET and FASCINATION mysteries (stolen straight from decades of successful marketing promotions) \u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Combine them with proven declarations for growing response, both online and offline \u2026</p><p><br></p><p>And ultimately, purify it all via one of the most REPUTABLE copywriters to have used a pen \u2026</p><p><br></p><p>Do all this, and you've got a viciously effective new bullet-writing strategy that will transform your copywriting and marketing!</p><p><br></p><p>\"If you've ever wondered how to write direct response-boosting, order-pulling BULLETS, and FASCINATIONS that genuinely maintain your ideal customers tossing and spinning, incapable of sleeping until he collects your product \u2026 then this will be one of the most significant marketing notes that you will ever come across!\"</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should you read \"the secrets I reveal in the following pages\"?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Simple:</strong></p><p>Because the capacity to write unique bullets and fascinations is one of the most exciting talents, you'll EVER achieve as a copywriter. And the capability to identify both useful and imperfect ones is essential to being a great direct response entrepreneur or marketing manager.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Don't believe me? Just browse through a stack of commands.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You'll discover LOTS of sales notes and even more extensive promotions based entirely on outstanding bullets and fascinations. This is remarkably factual when selling books \u2014 like Boardroom and Rodale do via the mail. And like many Internet marketers accomplish online.</p><p><br></p><p>Every great A-list writer has acquired the capacity to compose world-class bullets, and it's UNUSUAL to see a large package without at least 10 to 20, if not even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, it's problematic not to cherish them \u2014 these tiny benefit-packed JEWELS do so much in such a small space!</p><p><br></p><p>Nine times out of TEN, bullets and fascinations propose blessings \u2026 but GREAT ones do considerably better than that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The best bullets and fascinations often accomplish the following:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Enormously inspire curiosity and intrigue \u2026</p></li><li><p>Entice your ideal customer to read, read, READ!</p></li><li><p>Create desire \u2014 step by step \u2014 by creating the desire to \"learn\" the mystery your bullet swears to disclose \u2026</p></li><li><p>Grab your prospect's attention and maintain him zooming on the copy \u2026</p></li><li><p>Make your sales message easily readable (which consistently increases response!) \u2026</p></li><li><p>Pump up your publicity with a mixture and stop the disastrous \"flat\" benefit syndrome \u2026</p></li><li><p>Crush \"headline block,\" immediately offering a fortune of fantastic headline options \u2026</p></li><li><p>And many, many more!.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How to write GREAT bullets that make it Inconceivable for your copy to be ignored</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Writing excellent bullets and fascinations is really a science. It's about carrying all the suitable instruments and creating a little powerhouse of desire.</p><p><br></p><p>Suppose you're writing bullets for a fascinations book or a premium brochure. In that circumstance, you'll typically begin by examining the daylights out of your topic.</p><p><br></p><p>Legends like the bright direct response marketer \"<strong>Gene Schwartz</strong>\" would start reading a book numerous times, emphasizing key points and tidbits with each read. Then he'd ask his secretary or a typist to organize his notes (which would frequently add up to a 70-page manuscript!) Eventually, he'd organize the bullets and commence filling in the running text, completing the fascinations as they came to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Others have a negligibly different approach. Clayton's exemplary mate and seven-figure direct response writer, Parris Lampropoulos, start by scanning through his analysis and writing as many as 800 fascinations. Talk about discipline! He'll likely only maintain about 100 of them at the most. Still, Parris likes to have approximately eight times more than he could ever utilize.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an elite system because it ensures that every bullet or desire that makes it into the final draft is impressive. He selects precisely from the \"cream of the crop\" rather than some useful ones and a ton of tolerable ones. (I'm sure you've noticed this issue \u2014 specifically online \u2014 where you're reading a long line of bullets, and 3 out of 4 are passable, at best. You can gamble that the writer didn't note seven times what he required and then pick his best!)</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at Parris's writings, I witness how this offers him many mixtures in his bullet sections, making them more fascinating and satisfying to read. This is paramount\u2014 especially in promotions implicating many fascinations \u2014 because even just one or two imperfect ones can cause your reader to begin \"skimming.\" Occasionally, a few horrible bullets can get your copy dumped!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Remember, \"your NUMBER One MISSION as a direct response MARKETER is to keep your Ideal CUSTOMER READING!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As you know, the essential purpose of copywriting is to CONVERT A CUSTOMER TO MAKE THE SALE. And, without question, the most reasonable way to do so is to keep your Ideal customer reading.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever witnessed when you're reading sales copy\u2026 if you read or research a good one from beginning to end\u2026 Do you start sensing that you DESIRE the product? That's the enchantment of a long copy! But it ONLY functions if you MAINTAIN your prospect's interest and curiosity to the end.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why Clayton frequently debates systematically about weeding out \"ineffective associations\" in your text\u2014 because weak connections push you to lose the reader's attention. And eventually, cause you to lose sales. Because they're so comfortable to read, bullets can be the most harmful of weak links.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why, if you bore your ideal customer with impotent or redundant bullets, the best-case strategy is that he begins flipping and scanning (the contrary to what you desire). This is one step from placing the letter down or tossing it in the garbage.</p><p><br></p><p>So you want to create and change your bullets, so your copy has a natural flow and doesn't seem fake. This signifies that some bullets need to be long, others short, some bullets blind, and others where you disclose the complete secret your ideal customer can directly benefit from.</p><p><br></p><p>Reading bullets should provide your prospect with a thrilling sensation. Almost like he's on a roller coaster adventure and doesn't predict which way he's going to be turned next.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can keep your prospect reading through a long string of high-quality bullets and fascinations, your possibilities of making the sale rise exponentially!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to CRUSH \"headline block\" for REAL</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And here's another compelling benefit you'll obtain when you become a terrific bullet and fascination writer. Having an army of killer bullets and fascinations in your possession gives you a slew of outstanding headline opinions and opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the finest writers in the industry will often begin their writing approach with bullets and fascinations.</p><p><br></p><p>That way, when it's time to compose the headline, you've got dozens \u2026 if not HUNDREDS of great potential options for an incredible headline.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the more current models of a winning headline that started as a bullet is from the control for Bottom Line Personal: \"<strong>How Doctors Stay Well While Treating Sick People All Day.\"</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was simply the most fascinating, benefit-based bullet out of hundreds reported by the package's author. If you see, it also indicates \"<strong>credibility</strong>\" because it mentions doctors. (We'll examine the demand for evidence and credibility in your bullets more in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>To work the same magic in your script, just write LOTS of bullets concealing every shocking, captivating, and emotionally touching amount of data you hold. When you've finished, you'll have at least a few awesome headlines \u2014 presumably at least 1-2 GREAT ones!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4773334/preview/?startPreviewId=42385422", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4785722", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Strategy", "title": "Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations", "content_length": "81", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Baba Oyewole", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "25", "students": "5489", "coupon_code": "STRATEGICPARTNER2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4785722_1b39_4.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/strategic-partnerships-and-collaborations/?couponCode=STRATEGICPARTNER2", "expired_date": "2022-11-30 14:10:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "141", "headline": "Everything you need to know about setting up partnerships and collaborations", "description": "<p>Strategic Partnerships can transform your start up or business.</p><p>I created this course out of my experiences consulting and working with businesses for over 22 years. </p><p>I realised that MOST successful businesses leverage partnerships as a major pillar of their business.</p><p>This course helps you see and understand ways to go about setting up strategic partnerships to help grow your business, manage costs, gain market share, raise profiles, increase visibility, consolidate existing sectors, enter into new sectors, increase revenues, access technologies and so on. </p><p>We also look at examples of good or well known successful partnerships.</p><p><br></p><p>Great and successful strategic partnerships across various sectors do the following.</p><p><br></p><p>They ask question such as the below and how can you find such alliances considering:</p><p>1).
