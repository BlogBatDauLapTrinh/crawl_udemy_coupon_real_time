Fortunately, this course is designed to be useful for both beginners and experts.</p><p>Our course starts at the basics, such as <strong>how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free</strong>, and then moves through an in-depth analysis of the software.</p><p>The course is designed so learners can go from start to finish but also have the option of jumping to the most relevant parts of the course, using the course as a reference guide to fall back on as needed, a dependable and up-to-date reference guide.</p><p><strong>We have updated this course each year and plan on continuing to do so as long as learners find it useful</strong>.</p><p>Courses on how to use software become outdated fast unless instructors are committed to updating the material, as we are. </p><p>The first part of the course will demonstrate how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free, download it, and install it.</p><p>We will then use the sample file provided by QuickBooks to learn how to navigate the accounting software, locate the most commonly used areas, and understand the relationship between data input and the final product of financial statements and related reports.</p><p>The sample file is an excellent tool for learning how to navigate the software because it already has data in it, allowing us to deconstruct the process of data input by going to the end result of financial statements and drilling back to the source documents used to enter the data.</p><p>We will analyze transactions by accounting cycle: vendor cycle, customer cycle, and employee cycle. The vendor cycle may also be called the payment cycle, purchases cycle, account payable cycle, or expenses cycle. The customer cycle may also be called the revenue cycle, sales cycle, or accounts receivable cycle.</p><p>The course will break down the flow of data input forms in each cycle and the impact of each form on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>In the next major section of the course, we will start a new company file, an essential process for learning how to set up the foundational accounting system components like the chart of accounts, service items, revenue items, and beginning balances.</p><p>Learners will enter two months of data input along with instructional videos, entering a wide variety of common transactions and analyzing the impact of each on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, learners will prepare bank reconciliations using demonstration bank statements, learning how to perform a bank reconciliation, why we reconcile, and what outstanding items are.</p><p>The course also has an extensive section on how to use bank feeds. Learners will learn how to connect to the bank, download bank feeds into QuickBooks, and add the necessary data to include the bank data into the accounting system to create financial transactions or verify transactions that have already been created. We will also cover how to use bank rules to make data input much faster and more efficient. The course will demonstrate data input using bank feeds for checking, credit card, and PayPal accounts.</p><p>Next, we will enter adjusting entries; entries used to adjust financial statement reports more closely to their accounting basis as of the end of the month or year. Common accounting basis includes accrual basis, cash basis, or tax basis.</p><p>Learners will also understand how budgets fit into the accounting process, what some best practices are to construct a budget, how to enter a budget into QuickBooks, and how to run budget reports.</p><p>The course also has information on more specialized topics like using account numbers, customizing forms, using class tracking, memorizing transactions, and multiple currencies.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This is a basic course that covers the topics of eating disorder. This course is suitable only for students &amp; not counsellors or therapists.</p><p><strong>Eating disorders</strong> are behavioral conditions characterized by severe and persistent disturbance in eating behaviors and associated distressing thoughts and emotions. They can be very serious conditions affecting physical, psychological and social function. Types of eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, other specified feeding and eating disorder, pica and rumination disorder.</p><p>Taken together, eating disorders affect up to 5% of the population, most often develop in adolescence and young adulthood. Several, especially anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are more common in women, but they can all occur at any age and affect any gender. Eating disorders are often associated with preoccupations with food, weight or shape or with anxiety about eating or the consequences of eating certain foods. Behaviors associated with eating disorders including restrictive eating or avoidance of certain foods, binge eating, purging by vomiting or laxative misuse or compulsive exercise. These behaviors can become driven in ways that appear similar to an addiction.</p><p>Eating disorders often co-occur with other psychiatric disorders most commonly mood and anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder and alcohol and drug abuse problems. Evidence suggests that genes and heritability play a part in why some people are at higher risk for an eating disorder, but these disorders can also afflict those with no family history of the condition. Treatment should address psychological, behavioral, nutritional and other medical complications. The latter can include consequences of malnutrition or of purging behaviors including, heart and gastrointestinal problems as well as other potentially fatal conditions. Ambivalence towards treatment, denial of a problem with eating and weight, or anxiety about changing eating patterns is not uncommon. With proper medical care however, those with eating disorders can resume healthy eating habits, and recover their emotional and psychological health.</p><p>This course is created by Vyas Psychology Training Centre</p>",

            "description": "<p>Compassion-focused therapy (CFT) aims to help promote mental and emotional healing by encouraging people in treatment to be compassionate toward themselves and other people. Compassion, both toward the self and toward others, is an emotional response believed by many to be an essential aspect of well-being. Its development may often have the benefit of improved mental and emotional health.</p><p>Trained mental health professionals may offer CFT in their practice to help and support individuals in treatment who wish to explore ways to relate to themselves and others with greater compassion.</p><p>According to CFT theory, the threat, drive, and contentment systems evolved throughout human history in order to facilitate survival. Early humans were eager to avoid or overcome threats, seek resources such as food or intimacy, and enjoy the benefits of being part of a social community. Proponents of CFT suggest these systems are still active and affect human emotions, actions, and beliefs today. If a threatening stimulus is received, for example, a person may experience different feelings (such as fear, anxiety, or anger), exhibit various behaviors (submission or a fight or flight response), and develop certain cognitive biases (jumping to conclusions, stereotyping, or assuming it is always better to be safe than sorry).</p><p>The drive system endeavours to direct individuals toward important goals and resources while fostering feelings of anticipation and pleasure. People with an over-stimulated drive system may engage in risky behaviors such as unsafe sexual practices or drug and alcohol abuse.</p><p>The contentment system is linked with feelings of happiness. These feelings are not associated with pleasure seeking, nor are they merely present due to an absence of threats. Rather, this state of positive calm is typically tied to an awareness of being socially connected, cared for, and safe. This soothing system acts as a regulator for both the threat and drive systems.</p><p>CFT can be helpful to people who find it challenging to understand, feel, or express compassion, as therapy can be a safe place in which to discover any reasons behind this difficulty and explore methods of positive change. This type of therapy can also be effective at helping people manage distressing thoughts, behaviors, and feelings of any kind but may be particularly helpful when dealing with feelings associated with self-attack. Other concerns treated with CFT include:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Anxiety</p></li><li><p>Shame</p></li><li><p>Self-criticism</p></li><li><p>Depression</p></li><li><p>Disordered eating</p></li><li><p>Anger</p></li><li><p>Self-injury</p></li><li><p>Psychosis</p></li></ul><p>This course is created by Vyas Psychology Training Centre</p>",

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology. </p><p>Time to shine.</p>",

A temple is dedicated to a particular god or goddess (deity). The temple is the god's home on earth. The most holy part of the temple is an inner shrine called a garbhargriha with a statue to the god or goddess. This inner shrine is under a towering roof called a sikhara. The four corners of the temple then have smaller shrines. The temple is entered through the ardhamandapa or entrance porch. Hindu temples are often decorated with the figures of gods and goddesses. Outside Hindu temples you can often buy gifts or prasad to give the deity honored in the temple.</p><p>There is no set schedule for visits to a temple. Worshippers go when they want. When entering a temple, visitors must take off their shoes and women cover their heads to show respect. The ceremony that follows is called puja. It includes prayer and a viewing of the statue of the god or goddess honored. Offerings of fruit, flowers and incense are made to a priest who presents them to the deity. After the deity blesses the gifts they are returned to the worshipper and their heads are marked with a red dot or blessing called a tilaka. Worshippers then circle the inner shrine with their right hand raised in respect to the deity.</p><p>It is also very common for Hindus to worship at a home shrine, often as a whole family. There might be a statue or just a picture of the god or goddess. The shrine also contains things which represent the five senses. The idea is to draw the whole person into worship through the image or statue and the senses. The goal is to get beyond self to Brahmin. A bell is also often rung to help focus the mind.</p><p>The Ganges River is a very sacred place to Hindus. It is a place to go on pilgrimage to bathe in sacred waters. Hindus also like to have their ashes scattered in the Ganges after cremation.</p><p>Outside Hindu temples, you can often buy gifts or prasad to give the deity honored in the temple.\u200b</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>To highlight the sacred places in Hindu Temple\u200b</p></li><li><p>To out the sacred spaces in Hindu Temple\u200b</p></li><li><p>To find out the significance of sacred symbols in Hindu Temple.</p></li></ul>",

            "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Multithreading with Java Examples.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course! And remember, we appreciate all your feedback! Your feedback will help us to become even better!&nbsp;Your feedback will help us to create to best Java course ever! </p><p>See you at the lessons!&nbsp;:)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

            "description": "<p>Welcome to our latest course, which will guide you through the process of installing, securing, and configuring NGINX or Apache on an Ubuntu web server. You will also learn to encrypt all web traffic, using a Free SSL certificate from Let\u2019s Encrypt.</p><p><strong>APACHE Section:</strong></p><p>This course begins with exploring the most widely used web server technology available, Apache. Statistics show that Apache is used to run over 65% of all web servers around the world. Understanding how to work with Apache, is an instrumental part of the web development process. Students will learn the following key concepts:</p><ul><li><p>Deploying a virtual server on Digital Ocean</p></li><li><p>Working with dynamic, static and floating IPs</p></li><li><p>Using Terminal for remote authentication</p></li><li><p>Installing and configuring LAMP Stack on Ubuntu 18.04</p></li><li><p>Testing PHP</p></li><li><p>Hosting Multiple Domains on one Apache Virtual Server</p></li><li><p>Configuring Virtual Host Files and Directives</p></li><li><p>DNS Zone File Configuration</p></li></ul><p><strong>NGINX Section:</strong></p><p>NGINX is now considered the most powerful, efficient, and secure web server technology used to host web applications of all sizes and complexity. The software is open-source, and is designed for maximum performance and stability. It also aims to correct many of the short-falls of Apache, when it comes to delivering content to your end user. NGINX can be used for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and much more.</p><p>The NGINX Section of this course will help you understand the following key concepts:</p><ul><li><p>Understanding the difference between Apache &amp; NGINX</p></li><li><p>Installing NGINX on a Digital Ocean Droplet or any Virtual Server of your choice.</p></li><li><p>Modifying the NGINX Block Configuration file for hosting Websites</p></li><li><p>Installing essential components on NGINX such as MySQL, PHP &amp; PhpMyAdmin</p></li><li><p>Securing PhpMyAdmin using symbolic links and NGINX's built in authentication gateway.</p></li><li><p>Securing your hosted websites with free SSL using Certbot &amp; Let's Encrypt</p></li><li><p>Installing and Configuring WordPress on your NGINX Server</p></li></ul><p><strong>SSL Certificates - Let's Encrypt</strong></p><p>This section of the course offers an in-depth look into the role of SSL certificates when it comes to server security and web traffic encryption. We start with a thorough introduction which includes exploring different types of certificates and how they work. From there, students create a droplet on Digital Ocean and configure their own free SSL certificate using Let\u2019s Encrypt Certificate Authority. This section of the course combines theoretical and hands-on training. Students have the opportunity to practice some of the concepts explored in the previous two sections, while also learning about free SSL Certificates, such as Let\u2019s Encrypt.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong><em>Technology is a flourishing sector today, with a plethora of intriguing and innovative products as well as new learning opportunities. </em></strong>Apps and wearable technology, as well as digital fitness platforms and equipment, are among the most popular fitness technologies today. </p><p>Putting aside the excitement of new developments, the convenience that technology may provide is unrivalled. Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It's a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend's Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!! The health and fitness tech business is greatly growing at a breakneck pace, thanks to advances in wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and even mixed reality, making it an exciting time for both customers and developers.</p><p>Oculus stealthily released a fitness tracker called Oculus Move that sits inside its Quest headsets in the final days of 2020. Users who download the software can climb on a ticker hovering above or below their field of view to see how many calories they burn in virtual reality, as well as how many minutes they spend physically active. They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker's dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.</p><p>Apps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of every year, according to the World Economic Forum. It's a big increase, demonstrating how popular home fitness has become, with hundreds of subscription-based options now accessible. One standout brand has been setting the pace and capitalising on consumer demand called 360 Wellness.&nbsp;360 Wellness is a decentralised and unique live wellness marketplace concept. It's really a robust set of web and mobile applications that connect individuals with health and fitness specialists all over the world. </p><p>Let's now look at what kind of incredible stuff you will be learning in this course titled <strong>\"New-Age Technologies For Fitness Trainers\" </strong>that has been created by<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Piyush\".</em></strong></p><p>We will learn that technological advancements continue to have an enormous impact on practically every aspect of our life. People's communication, information seeking, music listening, meal ordering, and shopping habits have all changed as a result of them. We will also discover how technology is creating a huge impact on the fitness businesses and professionals, with even gyms changing how they deliver workout routines. What's more?&nbsp;We will be learning about wearable tech, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;on the fitness industry and unveiling the future of fitness training using the 360 Wellness App. A topic lesson on 3D&nbsp;sports prototypes will ultimately amaze you to the core. Believe it or not!</p><p>So, why wait?&nbsp;Let's get started.&nbsp;Enrol now and let's start booming.</p>",

Before buying your course, My cost per lead used to be 35 to 50 rs per lead through my conventional targeting.

It's important to know what you want to achieve in order to choose the right objective. Your advertising objective is what you want people to do when they see your ads. For example, if you want to show your website to people interested in your business, you can create ads that encourage people to visit your website. As your business grows, your campaign goals will change. First, your campaigns may focus on building awareness and acquiring new customers. Later, you may encourage people to make a purchase or sign up for an event.</p><p><em>DAY 3: Learn How to Use Facebook Ads Library</em></p><p>Facebook Ads Library was designed to give anyone and everyone accesses to advertising taking place on Facebook. This approach is to promote transparency sharing as much information as possible. You have access to a collection of all advertisements running from across Facebook Products, including Instagram.</p><p><em>DAY 4: Learn Copywriting for your Facebook Ads. Create your own Facebook Ad Copy.</em></p><ol><li><p>Put all crucial info at the start of your copy</p></li><li><p>Emojis are your best friend</p></li><li><p>Keep it brief</p></li><li><p>Give people a reason to purchase</p></li><li><p>Remember \u2013 it\u2019s always about the sell.</p></li><li><p>Create copy tailored to your audience.</p></li><li><p>Use power words to inspire emotion.</p></li><li><p>Include social proof.</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 5: Learn How to Setup &amp; Use Facebook Business Manager</em></p><p>The purpose of Facebook Business Manager is to help you \u201cmanage ad accounts, Facebook pages, and the people who work on them \u2014 all in one place.\u201d Business Manager is more or less the hub for accessing all of your Facebook marketing needs, including ad accounts, catalogs, pixels, and business pages.</p><p><em>DAY 6: Learn How to Proceed Domain Verification</em></p><p>Apple has announced changes with iOS 14 that impact how Facebook receives and processes conversion events from business tools like the Facebook pixel. Domain verification helps Facebook ensure that only the rightful parties can edit link previews that direct to your content. Once you have verified your domain, you can assign specific Pages editing permissions for your ads. Pages associated with your Business Manager that do not have editing permissions won\u2019t be able to make changes to your ads.</p><p><em>It's free to verify your domains. There are 3 domain verification methods:</em></p><ol><li><p>Add a meta tag to your domain's home page</p></li><li><p>Upload an HTML file to your web directory and confirm ownership of your domain in Business Manager</p></li><li><p>Add a DNS TXT entry to your DNS record to confirm ownership of your domain</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 7: Learn How to Easily Setup Facebook Pixel &amp; Conversion API on WordPress</em></p><p>When you use the Conversions API along with our other Facebook Business Tools, you can gain additional insights into the people who interact with your business. Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.</p><p>The Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don't require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.</p><p><em>The Conversions API can help you to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity. Data from the Conversions API is less impacted than the pixel by browser loading errors, connectivity issues and ad blockers. When you use the Conversions API alongside the pixel, it creates a more reliable connection that helps the delivery system decrease your cost per action.</p></li><li><p>Optimize ads for actions that happen later in the customer\u2019s journey. Examples of these events include actions that happen after a purchase (such as subscriptions), actions that happen in stores, or even customer scores. This information helps Facebook show your ads to customers who are more likely to be profitable and generate value for your business.</p></li><li><p>Improve measurement. The Conversions API can help you better measure ad performance and attribution across your customer\u2019s full journey, from discovery to conversion. This helps you better understand how digital advertising impacts both online and offline results.</p></li><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of increased event matching. Your marketing data is most effective when it can be matched with accounts on Facebook apps and services. With the Conversions API, you can include additional customer information parameters that help increase matched events and your Event Match Quality score.</p></li><li><p>Increase data control. When implemented separately from the pixel, the Conversions API gives you more control over what you share and when you share it.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 8: Learn How to Use &amp; Setup Pixel Events. Learn Using Events Manager.</em></p><p>Facebook uses marketing data to show ads to people who are likely to be interested in them. One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).</p><p><em>DAY 9: Learn How to Use, Setup &amp; Optimise Facebook Aggregated Events</em></p><p>Facebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users. Aggregated Event Measurement limits domains to 8 conversion events that can be prioritized for conversion optimization. So, please, learn with me Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads for 2023. If you optimize your ads for non-prioritized events, your ads won\u2019t deliver to and report on people who are opted-out of tracking on their Facebook or Instagram apps on an iOS 14.5 or later device. Facebook solution is analogous to Apple\u2019s Private Click Measurement, but it is designed to solve for key advertiser use cases not addressed by Apple\u2019s proposal. </p><p><em>DAY 10: Learn Facebook Reach Ads</em></p><p>The reach objective maximizes the number of people who see your ads and how often they see them. Choose this objective if you want to build brand awareness, change brand perception or show your ad to as many people in your audience as possible. With this objective, you can choose to maximize your reach or impressions for the entire duration of your campaign. You can set frequency controls for how many times a person sees your ad and the minimum number of days between each time they see it. For example, let's say you want your ads to reach a large proportion of your target audience to help increase sales. You can also tailor your reach with location targeting to reach people within a certain radius of your business location. You can simply choose the reach objective to show ads to a larger portion of your audience.</p><p><em>DAY 11: Learn Facebook Traffic Ads</em></p><p>The traffic objective is designed to drive people to your website or app. With traffic as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Send people to a destination such as a website, app, phone call or Messenger conversation (Website Clicks)</p></li><li><p>Increase the number of people going to your mobile or desktop app (App Engagement)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 12: Learn Detailed Targeting on Facebook &amp; Creating your Persona</em></p><p>Define your audience for smarter ad targeting.With Core Audiences, you set the rules for where your ads are delivered. Adjust your target audience to be as broad or well-defined as you like, based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li><p>Location.Advertise in the cities, communities and countries where you want to do business.</p></li><li><p>Demographics. Choose your audience based on age, gender, education, job title and more. You can keep track of the types of people your ads are reaching, but Facebook will never share personally-identifiable information about them.</p></li><li><p>Interests. Add interests and hobbies of the people you want your ad to reach \u2013 from organic food to action films \u2013 and make your targeted ads more relevant.</p></li><li><p>Behaviour. Target your ads based on consumer behaviours such as prior purchases and device usage.</p></li><li><p>Connections. Choose to include people who are connected to your Facebook Page or event, or exclude them to find new audiences.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 13: Learn How to Create Attractive Video Carousels for Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads</em></p><p>The carousel format lets you show 2 or more images and/or videos in a single ad, each with its own headline, description, link and call to action. To scroll through a carousel, people swipe on their mobile device or click the arrows on their computer screen.</p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages. Give customers more options and help raise your clickthrough rate.</p></li><li><p>Highlight multiple features of a single product. Show different product angles or details to better educate customers.</p></li><li><p>Tell a story. Use images and/or videos in succession to illustrate a compelling narrative.</p></li><li><p>Explain a process. Walk people through how your business works step by step.</p></li><li><p>Sell the benefits. If your business is in the service industry, use images and/or videos to show the benefits to new customers.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 14: Learn about the Power of Engagement. Create Powerful Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences from Engagement.</em></p><p>Nobody knows more about us than our mother, our wife, and Facebook. So it\u2019s very easy for Facebook to create an exact lookalike audience for you. For example, Facebook can create a very similar audience to people that have been already engaging with your content.</p><p><em>DAY 15: Learn Facebook Engagement Ads</em></p><p>The engagement objective is designed to get more people to see and engage with your Facebook post or Page. With engagement as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Boost your posts (Post Engagement)</p></li><li><p>Promote your Page (Page Likes)</p></li><li><p>Raise attendance at an event on your Page (Event Responses)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 16: Learn Facebook Lead Generation Ads</em></p><p>Lead generation is the process of building interest in a business's products or services. On Facebook, you can create campaigns using a lead generation objective that allows consumers to fill out a form, called an \"Instant Form,\" with their contact information.</p><p><em>DAY 17: Learn How to Use Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences to Get Better Results</em></p><p>A Custom Audience is an ad targeting option that lets you find your existing audiences among people who are on Facebook. A lookalike audience is a way your ads can reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they share similar characteristics to your existing customers. </p><p><em>DAY 18: Learn Conversion Ads &amp; Commerce Manager</em></p><p>The Facebook Website Conversion objective helps you to grow business on your website. Whether you want page visits, sales or another action, website conversion ads encourage people to go to your website and do something.</p><ul><li><p>Grow sales. Get people to complete transactions on your website.</p></li><li><p>Prompt an action. Define the action that you want people to take \u2013 from visiting your site, to adding something to their basket.</p></li><li><p>Increase traffic. Encourage people to visit a specific page or explore your whole website.</p></li></ul><p>Conversion ads are special kinds of ads where Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are trying their best to drive audiences to your website that are more likely to buy your products or give you a lead. For these ads you often have to retarget with custom and lookalike audiences. You mainly retarget your website visitors and already engaged people from your Facebook business page and Instagram profile. As every business is different, you can also test standard targeting based on age, interests, location and income.</p><p><em>DAY 19: Learn How to Create Attractive Carousels for E-Commerce</em></p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to sell more on your E-Commerce:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages. Give customers more options and help raise your clickthrough rate.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 20: Learn Catalog Sales (Dynamic Ads) &amp; Commerce Manager:</em></p><p>Dynamic ads are the most powerful retargeting tool that can transform all your biggest battles into great victories. They require automated synchronization with e-commerce platforms like Shopify, and correct Pixel set up as well as catalogue feeds for standard websites. They\u2019re available for e-commerce, travel industry, automotive and real estate businesses. They help you to retarget your website visitors dynamically according to content they\u2019ve been looking at. It can be a product, offer or even a property.

Wouldn't it be nice to know exactly what your audience is understanding or not understanding about your technical expertise?&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tIn this <strong>Public Speaking</strong>:&nbsp;How to Deliver Technology Presentations course, you will learn the following:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to avoid the common blunders that destroy most technology presentations&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to simplify your message&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to make your key messages more understandable and memorable&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to use technology effectively when giving a technology presentation&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>Public Speaking</strong>&nbsp;course is delivered primarily through spoken lectures. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe <strong>public speaking</strong>&nbsp;skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>public speaking</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future technology presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your technology presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards.

And the instructor also provides an enhanced guarantee.<br></p><p>\"5 Stars! This course is primarily focused on making you better you a better presenter and communicator, period. Delivering talks around technology is woven into this course very well as a secondary focus. TJ Walker has a depth of knowledge/experience very smooth and relaxed reminds a relaxed reminds a bit of Steve jobs.

Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

            "description": "<p>We all know that search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting pages to rank higher in search engines like Google,&nbsp;Bing,&nbsp;Duckduckgo etc. Since search is one of the main ways people discover online content, ranking higher in search engines can lead to an increase in website traffic. SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.&nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.&nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.</p><p>If you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO)&nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing<strong> \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"J. Selva Antony Santosh\"</strong> is for you!&nbsp;This quiz also has the room for explanatory answers that it provides. It may be a tough test for you, still.</p><p><strong><em>All the very best to score well!</em></strong></p>",

            "description": "<p>\"3D animation is a technique which allows for each object or person to have their own three-dimensional space; this can create the illusion of depth while simultaneously creating motion within that world.\" &nbsp;</p><p>Good 3D&nbsp;animation is hard to create or execute and we all know it. What we must further be aware of is what is harder still is being committed to it in the long run as 3D animation is a vast, tiring and long process. Animation specialists know that <strong>2D</strong> is a more simple technique - whatsoever, so it's a lot easier to learn and execute, but it still takes just as much, and even often more, time to do than <strong>3D</strong>. On top of that, 3D is a lot more complicated than 2D.&nbsp;</p><p>It's for this reason that many producers are looking into 2D production as an animation technique. It's a technique that is not new though, but quite the contrary - it has been around since the '50s, actually much longer. However, it's been in the past couple of years that 3D animation has risen to the top. Just look at all the movies that were nominated this year for an Academy Award and you'll see that most, if not all of them, are 3D. If you think about all those movies, for example, \"Life of Pi\", \"Hugo\", and \"Hayao Miyazaki's\" movies (\"The Wind Rises\" and \"Ponyo\"), they were all done in 3D. This past year saw a large rise in 3D movies than 2D movies, especially when you compare it to the years before.</p><p>The 3D&nbsp;animation process normally has three phases associated with it being - the following stages:</p><p><strong>1. Pre-production stage:</strong>&nbsp;This process includes concept creation, creating rough storyboards, making script reels, and character modelling. This is the most difficult stage of it all and also it involves a lot of brainstorming to be done by a huge team who will be working on the animation project.</p><p><strong>2. Production stage: </strong>This involves the creation of the animated film's animated elements brought together layer-by-layer and scene-by-scene, all into one place, ready for the final touches to be done or applied. This is usually termed as the \"Creation Stage\" too.</p><p><strong>3. Post-production stage:&nbsp;</strong>This stage deals with rendering of the 3D animation and editing the video using any video editing software like Adobe Premiere Pro, iMovie for Mac or Final&nbsp;Cut Pro (FCP).</p><p>The above phases also have multiple sub-processes within them.&nbsp;Thus, this makes 3D animation a complicated process - <strong><em>until now</em>!</strong></p><p><em>Forget being an animation specialist or learning 3D&nbsp;animation from scratch.&nbsp;</em></p><p><strong><em>What if we told you that you could create amazing 3D animation videos at high speed using the world's most powerful and secretive software?&nbsp;What if we told you that this is all possible without modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting or manual animation unlike leveraging traditional animation software to create a 3D output? </em></strong></p><p>This means simply speeding up the three phases that we just talked about above by 99x. (You can create animation 99 times faster than using regular methods or software) and that's what we mean.</p><p>Welcome to the new age of 3D animation that can be generated with a single audio file you put across to the software - which we will reveal in this course. We will also look at changing characters, backgrounds colours etc. to be used in your video.</p><p>This superb and futuristic tech course has been created by Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi Ranganathan\" </strong>and Mastermind<strong> \"Saranya Srinidhi\"</strong>. </p><p>Are you ready to create mind-blowing 3D virtual human avatar videos at great speed?

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course in Tamil will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>About Electronics</strong></p><p>Electronics is a branch of physics and electrical engineering that studies electron emission, behavior, and effects using electronic devices. Electronics differs from classical electrical engineering in that it uses active devices to control electron flow via amplification and rectification, whereas classical electrical engineering only uses passive effects such as resistance, capacitance, and inductance to control electric current flow.</p><p>Electronics covers an extremely broad range of technology. Initially, the term referred to the study of electron behaviour and movement, particularly as observed in the first electron tubes. With advances in knowledge about the fundamental nature of electrons and how the motion of these particles could be utilised, it came to be used in a broader sense. Many scientific and technical disciplines now deal with various aspects of electronics. The development of key devices such as transistors, integrated circuits, lasers, and optical fibres has resulted from research in these fields. As a result, a wide range of electronic consumer, industrial, and military products can now be manufactured. Indeed, the world is in a state of flux.</p><p>Electronic systems design is concerned with the multidisciplinary design of complex electronic devices and systems such as cell phones and computers. The topic ranges from the design and development of an electronic system (new product development) to ensuring its proper function, service life, and disposal. Electronic systems design is thus the process of defining and developing complex electronic devices to meet the user's specified requirements.</p><p>Laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices due to the complexity of electronics theory. These experiments are used to test or validate the engineer's design and to identify errors. Historically, electronics labs were made up of physical electronics devices and equipment, but in recent years, the trend has shifted to electronics lab simulation software such as CircuitLogix, Multisim, and PSpice.</p><p><br></p>",

            "description": "<p>There\u2019s a HUGE difference between simply operating a used car dealership business and operating a profitable used car dealership. To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.</p><p><br></p>",

It is done for the purpose of planning the budget and evaluating productivity. It is helpful for administrators to assess which goods, units, or programs are most efficient and which ones require enhancement.</em></p><p><em>Cost management includes assessing expenses that are fixed and adjustable. Fixed costs are losses that recur each month regardless of the manufacturing rate. Types cover leasing, depreciation, loan interest, and rental charges. Dynamic costs are expenditures that fluctuate with shifts in the level of production, such as costs of inventory, labour, and maintenance. Such costs are related to manufacturing in that the higher the units of a product produced, the greater the price associated with the materials and labour involved in the production of the item</em>.</p><p>This incredible course focusing on&nbsp;<strong><em>\"Cost Accounting and Artificial Intelligence Tools\"</em></strong> created by Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Practicing Cost and Management Accountant \"Ravi Pacha\" covers the following aspects of cost accounting which include: The meaning of cost accounting, various branches of cost accounting, functions of cost accounting, classification of cost, etc. Furthermore, we will walk you through some mind-blowing tools that leverage Artificial Intelligence in the field of Accounting to automate the complete accounting processes. While digital technology has evolved over the years, we've switched from tv to the Internet, and we're integrating Artificial Intelligence seamlessly and slowly today. John McCarthy coined the term AI for the first time in 1956. It involves many of the main things that range from robotics process automation to the actual robotics process. Because of the amount of data these types of organizations are working with, it has become highly popular with large companies today. Increasing demand for information pattern awareness has contributed to growth in the AI market. AI models are much more successful at detecting information trends than people, which help companies understand and gain insight into their target audience. Thousands of businesses around the world see AI as the next big thing for the finance industry. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can be used widely for financial transaction auditing systems. AI can also be a great help when it comes to processing a large number of pages for tax changes. Organizations dependent on AI can be expected to make major firm-related decisions in the near future. AI also has the ability to identify how consumers should respond to different circumstances and problems. Artificial Intelligence can help people and businesses make smarter choices at a very fast pace. But the key here is to find the right human-machine balance.</p><p>Get ready to go wow.

The technique of automating social media activities in order to improve the results generated from social media channels is known as social media automation. It saves time and effort spent on administering social platforms, communicating with prospects, and increasing brand exposure for marketers.&nbsp;Let's now ask you a quick question.</p><p>Have you ever dreamt of automating your social media campaigns with a magical platform that creates, schedules and provides reports of branded social media content while you're busy doing something else? </p><p><strong><em>Welcome to learn and master Missinglettr - the game-changer in the social media marketing universe - a platform powered by automation.</em></strong></p><p>This amazing course created by <strong><em>Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Mastermind \"Saranya\" </em></strong><em>titled</em><strong><em> \"</em>Social Media Marketing on Autopilot with Missinglettr\"<em> </em></strong>discusses the various concepts of autopilot social media marketing and presents an incredible platform \"Missinglettr\" to solve the challenges marketers usually face when it comes to doing social media marketing in a manual method in order to switch to an automated one. </p><p>Is automation the key to achieving viral growth?&nbsp;If you ask us - the answer is a big \"Yes!\".&nbsp;</p><p>The widespread popularity of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn has had a significant impact on businesses' online reach. According to statistics, over 52% of the world's population utilises social media, equating to 3.2 billion users worldwide. Furthermore, the number of users continues to grow, with new individuals joining every day. These rising numbers demonstrate the marketing potential of social media networks. However, marketers face a difficult problem in utilising this potent technique. On social media, your brand must be consistent, accessible, and relevant. It's also critical to keep track of trends, evaluate the effectiveness of social media campaigns, and communicate with prospects on social media on a regular basis. It's challenging to do all of these things while operating many marketing initiatives. As a result, social media automation is an important part of marketing efforts.</p><p>Automation can help save yourself hundreds and hundreds of hours of manual work involved in curating and scheduling content for your social media posts to go live on your brand pages. What's more?&nbsp;It can also automatically help you discover content that is already trending and loved by your target niche' audience and share them seamlessly across all your social media platforms in a click as all the profiles are connected to a single dashboard. This can work wonders! </p><p>When it comes to measuring the results of your campaign, social media metrics are crucial. Compiling data should not prevent you from taking advantage of it. You must also make the best use of powerful analytics or reports function which we show you in the course so that you can gain valuable insights of what is happening across your social media channels. Social listening and sentiment analysis are two major and advanced social media automation jobs that allow brands to communicate with their prospects on a much deeper level too.</p><p>Enroll in the course now and let's start booming.&nbsp;There is no time to waste.</p><p>At the end of this course, Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan will discuss more tips on social media automation that will skyrocket your marketing to the next level of organic growth - whatsoever. Let's begin.&nbsp;It's high-time to grow your business and maximise ROI.</p>",

For any reason, if you are not happy with the course, the entire amount will be refunded back to your bank account.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong> So at the end of the day, you have nothing to lose. Enroll in the course with confidence and complete peace of mind and take your technical skills to the next level.</strong></p><p>Hello Everyone, I would like to introduce you to a brand new online course \u201cGetting started with Asus Tinker Board\u201d. I have always been a firm believer in learning by doing and in this course, you will learn what you need to know by hands-on experience. You don\u2019t need any special knowledge except basic computer skills to get started with the course. Every one of you comes from a different background and hence the course is crafted from basic to advanced level with minute details in every lecture.</p><p><strong>The course is divided into 8 sections. In the first section, you will learn in detail about the Asus tinker board and how it is different from its competitor Raspberry Pi.</strong></p><p>In the second section, we will understand how to burn the OS image to the SD card and use the tinker board as a full-fledged PC. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the IP scanner tool and then use the putty application to access the Linux terminal of the Asus tinker board.</p><p>Starting on a Tinker board is not always easy because you don\u2019t necessarily have the habit of using command lines. However, they are essentials and often faster or more efficient than going through the GUI. So in the third section, we will get to know about all the day to day usage Linux commands with practical examples.</p><p>The fourth section begins with remotely accessing the graphical user interface of the tinker board and understanding the basic GUI applications. Once we are done with this we will go ahead and understand the general-purpose input-output functionality.</p><p>In the fifth section, we will step into the world of physical computing. We will begin with a basic project where we will learn to program different LEDs and a buzzer. This will help us to understand the GPIO pin structure and how to use them for programming.</p><p>The sixth section exposes you to the intermediate level of project development. Here, you will learn to build automatic garden lights. This project will solve your day to day problems of manually turning the light ON in the evening and then turning it off again in the morning. You will learn to program and automate things as per your requirements.</p><p>In the seventh section, we will go ahead with the advanced project where we will learn to build our own home automation project. We will first understand about the IoT and how it is implemented in real-time. You will learn to control your home appliances from anywhere. For example, If you are in the US, you will be able to turn off your lights from the UK.</p><p>Finally, in the eight section, you will come to know how to transfer files remotely from PC to Tinker Board. You will also go through what you have learned so far in the entire course.</p><p>Please note that the project covered in the course will work on any version of the Tinker Board.</p><p><strong>All the lectures contain English subtitles for clear and better understanding. If you face any technical issues, please post your query in the question and answer section and I will get back to you within 1 business day.</strong></p><p>At the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation on tinker board, relay and sensor usage, IoT dashboard implementation, etc. So apart from building this project, you will also find it easy to build any other project of your choice.</p><p>Thank You</p>",

            "description": "<p>Welcome to this ultimate course on <strong>\"Insight to Post Pandemic: Importance of Lean Six Sigma\" </strong>that contains vaulable lessons taught by \"Casey&nbsp;Ang\" and \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\".</p><p>Since its introduction as a corporate strategy by Jack Welch at General Electric in 1995, Six Sigma has come a long way. Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.</p><p>The Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as \u201cA fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\".</p><p>Six Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time. Six Sigma aspires to do the following - in general:</p><ul><li><p>Determine a problem.</p></li><li><p>Gather information about the problem's occurrence process.</p></li><li><p>Develop prospective problem-solving data-driven solutions.</p></li><li><p>To determine the best alternative, put the solutions to the test.</p></li><li><p>Create a system that will allow you to maintain a long-term solution.</p></li><li><p>Analyze the data and make any necessary adjustments. </p></li></ul><p>Let's get down to what this online course talks about. This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma's emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).</p><p>Please note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn't according to the client's specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer's perspective using Six Sigma methodology.</p><p><strong>Why opt for this course - the proven game-changer?</strong></p><p>By completing this<strong> \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\"</strong>, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!</p><p><em>This mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don't want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.&nbsp;What's more? We will teach you the five core skills of Lean Six Sigma that can be leveraged for individuals. We will also showcase the Lean Six Sigma organizational structure for better understanding of the concept topic.&nbsp;Other than that, we will discuss the salary range (in general)&nbsp;of various Lean Six Sigma Belts.&nbsp;These concepts will serve to be very interesting.&nbsp;All you need is passion and interest to learn and master this course!</em></p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning.

            "description": "<p><strong>QuickBooks Online bookkeeping business designed for small business clients or small businesses who want a simple cash basis format for entering data.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>This course is designed for bookkeepers and is also useful for small business owners who want a simple system for entering financial data into QuickBooks for financial planning and year-end tax preparation. </strong></p><p>The bookkeeping system we discuss will also describe the relationship between the bookkeeper, the business, and the year-end tax and financial statement preparers. </p><p>We will outline a cash basis bookkeeping system using QuickBooks, a system that will enter most transactions directly into the check register. </p><p>The course will discuss the responsibilities of a bookkeeper and the responsibilities of the business when a bookkeeping engagement in entered into.&nbsp; </p><p>We will work through a sample bookkeeping project in QuickBooks including the setting up of a new QuickBooks company file. </p><p>The course will practice entering data into the QuickBooks register directly from a bank statement. We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos. </p><p>As we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. </p><p>After entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. </p><p>The course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excel practice files</p><p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloadable PDF Files&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Who will we be learning from?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>",

We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos. </p><p>As we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. </p><p>After entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. </p><p>The course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>The course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 QuickBooks Backup files</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Excel practice files</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Downloadable PDF Files\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Who will we be learning from?\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who is a:\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Master of Science in Taxation\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Curriculum Development Export\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>As a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>As a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

Wouldn't it be great to know you can speak to the financial media and get the message you want into the final story?&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tIn this <strong>Media Training</strong> for Financial Service Professionals course, you will learn how to do the following:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* Look your best on TV&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* Create media messages&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* Answer financial reporters' questions&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* Speak in sound bites&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* Get the quotes you want in the final story&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis course is delivered primarily through spoken lectures. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and <strong>media&nbsp;training</strong> people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries.

Let us elaborate on this further. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows systems to learn and improve on their own without having to be explicitly programmed. Different algorithms (e.g. neural networks) are used in machine learning to address problems. The ever-trending field of machine learning is primarily focused on the development of computer coded programs that can access data and make machines learn themselves to perform mundane tasks autonomously. 'Autonomously' means that the task is not fully controlled by humans and machines play a bigger role in managing or scheduling them.</p><p>Why learn<strong> \"Digishock 2.0:&nbsp;The Ultimate Machine Learning Course of all time\"</strong>?</p><p>This mind-blowing course - the second course in the series of MBA&nbsp;in Programming and Trending Technologies titled <strong>\"Digishock 2.0: Learn Machine Learning (No Coding)\"</strong> taught by Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"Vindhya\"</strong> takes the huge leap from&nbsp;Digishock 1.0 and is for anyone who wants to get introduced to Machine Learning and Deep Learning without learning code, whatsoever.</p><p><strong>\"Digishock 2.0\"</strong> involves hands-on exercises with numerous tricks and techniques of analytics, advanced predictive concepts to work on to ensure that all are familiarised with the discipline of machine-learning, deep-learning, big data, analytics, etc. The USP of the course is that there is no kind of technical knowledge required whatsoever for students who will participate in this course.&nbsp;What's more?&nbsp;We also will cover the topics of how you can create an app in minutes based on any software or application and start the conversion process. You can explore the techniques to create a voice assistant in minutes like Amazon's Alexa and deploy the same for Raspberry Pi. </p><p>These inspiring and fast-track methods or techniques would help you gain new knowledge of this vast subject.&nbsp;Nevertheless, some of these product outputs you will receive from the tech tools taught here in the course can also be used for machine learning projects you would be submitting for your college university.</p><p>Enroll now in this mind-blowing machine learning course and be amazed by the technology and techniques taught. </p><p>Let's start booming.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p>",

But how many of our respected personal relationships are marked by a lack of feeling? The best way to create those genuinely meaningful relationships we all want to have with our clients is to concentrate on making stories more personally resonant, situationally important, and emotionally intelligent. Greater empathy is the real key to every goal - we have (as content marketers, and as people).</p><p>Further speaking, we know that devising a content marketing strategy isn't very easy. It depends on numerous factors.&nbsp;First, the objective of the content has to be defined and the audience persona has to be created. Second, the headline or the title of the article should be captivating. Then, the content written has to be unique and the Call-to-Action (CTA) has to be super-actionable.&nbsp;Once all the above attributes are taken care of, the content article has to be marketed in the right target niche' platforms for viral growth. </p><p>We should also not forget that the written content should appeal to the reader's emotions. It should evoke a sense of these universally recognisable emotions being:</p><ul><li><p>Surprise</p></li><li><p>Amusement</p></li><li><p>Joy</p></li><li><p>Contentment</p></li></ul><p>Content marketing demands consistency, always. You can\u2019t just throw a bunch of content on your website and expect it to generate traffic for the long run. If you create fresh content on a consistent basis, organic traffic will kick in from the search engines in due course of time. </p><p>Now, here's the thing.

            "description": "<p>This course has two main goals: to provide descriptions of specific EMDR therapeutic tools and, by incorporating these tools, to develop an overview of an Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model of the treatment of Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (Complex PTSD).</p><p>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a fairly new, nontraditional type of psychotherapy. It's growing in popularity, particularly for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD often occurs after experiences such as military combat, physical assault, rape, or car accidents.</p><p>Although research continues, EMDR remains controversial among some health care professionals.</p><p>At first glance, EMDR appears to approach psychological issues in an unusual way. It does not rely on talk therapy or medications. Instead, EMDR uses a patient's own rapid, rhythmic eye movements. These eye movements dampen the power of emotionally charged memories of past traumatic events.</p><p>The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has noted that EMDR is effective for treating symptoms of acute and chronic PTSD. According to the APA, EMDR may be particularly useful for people who have trouble talking about the traumatic events they've experienced. The APA guidelines note that other research is needed to tell whether improvements from EMDR can be sustained over time.</p><p>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a psychotherapy treatment that was originally designed to alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories (Shapiro, 1989a, 1989b). Shapiro\u2019s (2001) Adaptive Information Processing model posits that EMDR therapy facilitates the accessing and processing of traumatic memories and other adverse life experiences to bring these to an adaptive resolution. After successful treatment with EMDR therapy, affective distress is relieved, negative beliefs are reformulated, and physiological arousal is reduced.

            "description": "<p><strong><em>Someone said that the Future of Social Media is \"All Talk\" and nothing more - way back in the year 2016 - believe it or not!&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>He or she who thought about this true fact is absolutely right.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>Audio-based social media stepped up to the plate in response to a pandemic-induced demand for genuine connection while avoiding screen weariness this year. Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website. In the special lecture, we will be exploring a tool that allows you to share the recordings as a podcast and monetise them, also.</p><p>Why wait? We advise you to try out the social audio platforms taught in the course, keep an ear out for advertising opportunities, and start thinking about how to engage with your audiences or fans in an audible way - whatsoever.</p><p>1....2....3.....Enroll Now.

Virtual Cloud Servers have become the industry standard for hosting web applications of all sizes and complexity. This includes small static web pages, to dynamic, database driven web sites that handle thousands of simultaneous processes. Regardless of the project, virtual servers offer a solution that provides web developers a scalable infrastructure that can easily adapt to a changing environment.<br><br>The course starts with an overview of the registration process on Linode. From there, students quickly jump into deploying and configuring a server using the latest Ubuntu LTS distribution. Students will become familiar with the Linode admin interface, and start executing basic commands using the web based remote access console. We then explore remote access administration using more complex tools such as PuTTY for Windows, and Terminal for MAC.<br><br>Students will install and configure LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PhpMyAdmin) on the Ubuntu server. We show students how to secure the server through SSH Authentication, directory permissions, and disable root user access.<br><br>The course explores remote visual desktop configuration using TightVNC &amp; RealVNC.<br><br>Once students have a firm handle on server configuration on Linode, we take a look at another major cloud provider \u2013 Digital Ocean. This section of the course provides an overview of the Digital Ocean Admin panel where students will deploy and configure a \u201cDroplet\u201d. We will explore some of the unique features Digital Ocean offers, such as Floating IP\u2019s and Space storage.<br><br>Students learn to backup, resize, and configure DNS Zone files on both cloud hosting providers.</p>",

It powers the most commonly used database engines like PostgreSQL, SQL Server, SQLite, and MySQL. Simply put, If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><ol start=\"2\"><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people to get interesting data from the database. It is also an English-like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL queries easily.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><ol start=\"3\"><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li></ol><p><br></p><ol start=\"4\"><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basic try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Next few sections will cover help you with interviews and Vivas.</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p><strong>What's special about this course?</strong></p><p>The course is created on the basis of three pillars of learning:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Know (Study)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Do (Practice)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Review (Self feedback)</strong></p></li></ol><p><strong><em>Know</em></strong></p><p>We have created a set of concise and comprehensive videos to teach you all the SQL related skills you will need in your professional career.</p><p><strong>Do</strong></p><p>We also provide <strong>Exercises</strong> to complement the learning from the lecture video. These exercises are carefully designed to further clarify the concepts and help you with implementing the concepts on practical problems faced on-the-job.</p><p><strong>Review</strong></p><p>Check if you have learnt the concepts by executing your code and analyzing the result set.

If so, you are in the <strong>RIGHT </strong>place.</p><p><strong><br>How many times have you found yourself having to study and being stressed?&nbsp; Not being able to&nbsp;get started, and procrastinating? When you get enough traction to learn for 2 minutes, and then your focus shifts somewhere else\u2026</strong></p><p><strong>Does that seem familiar?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Hi there!</p><p>My name is Marcel. I am a <em>Life Coach</em> and a <em>Scientist</em>, and I have studied for many many years. In fact, to this date, I continue learning every day while working on a full time job. Since very little, I have been obsessed with productivity and how to do things faster and better, and learning more quickly always seemed like a superpower. If I could learn fast, I thought, I can do whatever! I can learn it all by myself!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Let me tell you a little bit of my story...</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I remember <em>vividly </em>that day. I was in front of my notes. I had to study for the \u2018Antennas\u2019 exam for my telecom bachelor. I thought two days were enough to learn a whole semester of material. However, I was confident I could do it. I had attended all the lectures and did the exercises, and although it all felt like a ball of concepts that were not yet understood and untangled, I was confident I could pass that exam.</p><p>The first hour of studying was challenging. I started realising that there were many concepts that I needed to learn, and there was no time to slow down! I had to go fast, as I only had two days to study! Three hours later, I was in a caf\u00e9 wondering if it made sense to continue studying. I continued a bit more until my brain could endure and went home.</p><p>The following day was even more complicated. Not necessarily the material, which I could not get properly, even a single thing with that feeling of rushing, but it was my head telling me that there was no chance to do well in that exam. There was frustration and a lot of negative self-talk. In the end, I didn\u2019t even go to the exam. I gave up and failed without even trying.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I was crushed...</strong></p><p><br></p><p>If I had taken the time to simplify the concepts and go one step at a time, then that ball of complex facts I needed to know where we were coming from would not have been there in the first place. But I procrastinated. I waited until the end to study, deluding that that could be any good. Not only that, but I also failed three more subjects, passing only one out of five subjects that semester. That is quite devastating for a person who has never really failed any subject.</p><p>As I reflected on what happened, I thought I did not see things from the proper perspective or was not studying well. So then, I started learning how to do things better and more straightforwardly and be more productive while enjoying the study time. I attended courses and read all the books and articles that were crossing in front of my eyes.</p><p>Afterwards, I started getting really good scores, honours in some subjects, to finally obtain a Ph.D. in medical imaging, a career as a scientist in industry, as well as a second career as a Life Coach.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I made many mistakes...</strong></p><p><br></p><p>For this reason, I designed this step by step course <strong>to skyrocket your studying skills</strong> with all this in mind. Not only that but also to lower your stress levels. In the beginning, it <strong>might feel strange</strong>. But, almost as if you are cheating, because<strong> you will feel less stressed, you will find yourself having more fun and accomplishing way more</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, I take you&nbsp; through the skills necessary to gain affinity in the five main concepts that will get you to mastery in your studies.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Clarity</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Energy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Information Quality</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Study Strategies</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Focus</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>If you master them all, you will be years ahead of your current version, and I want to witness that, so please do not forget to send me a message explaining how you achieved it! You are the reason this course exists!</p><p>Within the course, we will first start by looking at <strong>time management</strong>. Specifically, how to efficiently process the vast amount of information we receive daily. First, we will form the basis of a <strong>system </strong>that handles all the information. Then, we will talk about the importance of <strong>motivation, mood, nutrition, and exercise</strong>, <strong>the role they play in learning</strong>, and how to use them in our favour to enhance our learning capabilities. Then, we will learn a technique to create <strong>our study guide</strong>, a guide that will turn unstructured documentation into a highly customised learning highway. Effective use of time and recall is the following topic, where we will learn techniques to use time and recall efficiently the information we have previously known, as well as strategies as necessary as the use of <strong>spaced repetition</strong> with software like <strong>Anki</strong>. Last but not least, we will discuss <strong>focus</strong>, an essential aspect of learning to decrease study time while maximising <strong>productivity</strong>.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Here is some amazing feedback</strong></p><p>*****&nbsp; <strong>Ignacio Paz </strong>Agile Coach</p><p>This is a fantastic course that helps me to improve my time to get things done and adopt techniques to achieve my goals! </p><p><br></p><p>***** <strong>David Bofill </strong>Data Science Lead</p><p>Great content, easy to follow and understand.

Student\u2019s questioning the relevance of what they are learning causes students to lose interest. A loss of student interest causes students grades to fall.</p><p>Part of the reason accounting textbooks have a difficult time incorporating the current topic into the big picture is that a textbook is restricted by what can fit on a page and the problems a textbook provides are restricted by what a student can accomplish with paper and pencil.<br></p><p>The use of instructional video providing a step by step process along with Excel that allows students to sum up large columns of numbers in a short time provides the tools to create a comprehensive problem that will demonstrate current topics in the context of the entire accounting process.</p><p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p><p>We will learn the accounting cycle in a comprehensive way and learn the fundamental of Excel.</p><p>Learning the accounting process without Excel or Excel without accounting is a waste of time and not an efficient way to learn either topic.</p><p>Like assets being equivalent to liabilities and equity, accounting is equivalent to Excel in many ways and therefore learning Excel will accelerate our learning of accounting and make what we learn more applicable.</p><p>Accounting is also the perfect tool to learn Excel. This course will not provide a broad overview of everything Excel can do because that is not a way to learn. Courses attempting to demonstrate all the functions Excel fail to create value for learners because learners will not retain what they learn without a foundation of core concepts and a reason for learning each new function.</p><p>This course will cover the fundamentals of Excel, those components used 99% of the time, and the components needed as a foundation for learning more about Excel.</p><p>The core components of Excel we will learn include adding, subtracting, and summing up columns of numbers.</p><p>We will learn the core concept of Excel through demonstration, repetition, and application to practical problems.</p><p><strong>What Will Be Included in This Course?</strong></p><p>We will complete a comprehensive problem using both instructional video and application.</p><p>Although the course offers much more than just instructional video, it does include over 20 hours of instructional video.</p><p>We also include an Excel worksheet with just about every presentation allowing us to both see the completed answer and work through the problems step by step along with the video.</p><p>Each Excel workbook includes at least two tabs. One tab will have the answer so that we can see how the completed worksheet is constructed and the second tab will provide us the opportunity to enter the data along with the instructional video.</p><p><strong>Who Will We Be Learning From?</strong></p><p>We will be learning from somebody who has practical accounting experience as a practicing CPA, teaching experience, curriculum design experience.</p><p>Credentials include:</p><p>We are learning from someone who has both instruction and curriculum development experience needed to construct comprehensive courses of a technical nature in a way that meets students\u2019 needs and expectations.</p><p><strong>\u00a0What Will We Learn?</strong></p><p>We will learn how to complete the components of the accounting cycle and the fundamental of Excel including addition, subtraction, and the sum function.</p><p>Below is a short list of what is included in the accounting cycle and what we will cover in the course:</p><ul><li>Journalizing journal entries</li><li>Posting to the general ledger</li><li>Create a trial balance</li><li>Adjusting entries</li><li>Bank reconciliations</li><li>Financial statement generation</li><li>Closing entries</li><li>Reversing entries</li></ul><p><strong>How Will We Be Taught?</strong></p><p>We will learn through viewing and then doing.</p><p>We will demonstrate each component of the problem in small digestible parts using both a completed Excel worksheet and instructional video.</p><p>We will provide an Excel worksheet that can be filled in along with the instructional video or after watching the instructional video.</p><p><strong>Please join us in learning Accounting, Excel, debits, and credits.</strong></p><p><strong>It will be Great\u00a0</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Course Content Includes:</strong></p><ul><li>Start a New Business Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Set up New Company Worksheet</li><li>10 Set Up Inventory Items</li><li>15 Set Up Customer Balances</li><li>20 Set Up Vendors Beginning Balances</li><li>25 Enter Opening Account Balances</li><li>Accounting Concepts Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>135 Cash Method vs Accrual Method</li><li>132 Balance Sheet &amp; Income Statement Relationship</li><li>155 Financial Transaction Rules</li><li>160 Financial Transaction Thought Process</li><li>Enter Data for First Month Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Owner Deposit &amp; Loan Deposit</li><li>10 Purchase Furniture &amp; Record Investment</li><li>20 Part 1 Invoice Transaction</li><li>20 Part Two Create on Invoice Transaction</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 1</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 2</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 3</li><li>30 Cash Sales Transaction Part 1</li><li>30 Cash Sales Part 2</li><li>35 Deposit Part 1</li><li>35 Deposit Part 2</li><li>40 Part 1 Inventory Payment</li><li>40 Part 2 Inventory Payment</li><li>45 Invoice for Preordered Item Part 1.</li><li>45 Invoice for Pre-ordered Item Part 2</li><li>50 Receive Payment &amp; Make Deposit</li><li>55 Part 1 Write Check</li><li>55 Part 2 Write Check Part 2</li><li>60 Pay Bills</li><li>65 Customer Jobs</li><li>70 Payroll</li><li>75 Job Sales Receipt</li><li>80 Financial Statements &amp; Reports</li><li>90 Closing Process January</li><li>92 Worksheet Month Two</li><li>Enter Data for Second Month Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Make Loan Payments</li><li>10 Short Term Investment</li><li>20 Receive Inventory With Bill</li><li>20 Receive Inventory With Bill Part 2</li><li>25 Sales Receipt &amp; Deposit</li><li>25 Part 2 Sales Receipt &amp; Deposit</li><li>30 Advanced Payment From Customer</li><li>35 Apply Credit to Invoice</li><li>40 Record Sales on Account</li><li>45 Advance Customer Payment</li><li>50 Bills Track &amp; Pay</li><li>55 Customer Payment on Account</li><li>60 Pay Sales Tax</li><li>65 Pay Payroll Tax</li><li>70 Enter Bills &amp; Pay Bills</li><li>75 Service Item &amp; Invoices</li><li>77 Purchase Equipment with Debt</li><li>80 Payroll</li><li>90 Rental Income</li><li>95 Financial Statements</li><li>Bank Reconciliations Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>10 Bank Reconciliation January</li><li>12 Bank Reconciliation Adjusting Entries January</li><li>15 Bank Reconciliation February</li><li>20 Bank Reconciliation Feb.

            "description": "<p>This Pauline letter was written to address the verbal plague that was spreading through the Church. It advocated that what Jesus did on the cross was not good enough without circumcision. Hence Paul's responses were stern and yet with an unusual <strong>depth of Old Testament revelations. </strong></p><p><strong>As an example,</strong> Paul used the story of Ishmael mocking Isaac in the book of Genesis (21v9) to explain the manner the Jewish believers were persecuting the gentile believers at that time. Galatians 4vs28<strong> \"</strong><em>Now you, brothers and sisters, like Isaac, are children of promise. 29</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>At that time the son born according to the flesh persecuted the son born by the power of the Spirit. It is the same now. 30</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>But what does Scripture say? \u201cGet rid of the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman\u2019s son will never share in the inheritance with the free woman\u2019s son\".</em> </p><p><strong>We answer the following questions:</strong></p><p><strong>What is the major purpose of the book of Galatians?:</strong> We explore how Paul placed the Church on a strict \"Christ Alone\" diet as opposed to Christ and Moses/law. Paul emphasizes (as you will discover in the study) that the promise preceded the law therefore it did not set aside what God had planned that through Abraham - all the nations of the earth will be blessed.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>What is the main verses of Galatians?:</strong> We explore some of the key verses such as Galatians 3v1 <em>You foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes, Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</em></p><p>and </p><p>Galatians 3v<em>13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, for it is written: \u201cCursed is everyone who is hung on a pole.\u201d14 He redeemed us in order that the blessing given to Abraham might come to the Gentiles through Christ Jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</em></p><p><strong>What is the theme of Galatians 5?</strong> The Spirits triumph over the flesh. We learn how to live by the Spirit and not to fulfill the desires of the flesh.</p><p>All in all, we are in for a wonderful Bible Study experience. Join me as we hold hands together in the spirit and learn from this letter some life-transforming lessons that will reshape our lives! </p><p><br></p>",

            "description": "<p>Constant negative and worrying thoughts cause so much pain right? It is like a burden that makes everything difficult and leads to fatigue. We want to feel confident and reach our goals with enthusiasm but somehow we can't seem to do so. It is frustrating and tiring, we have the potential but something is wrong which causes so much worry &amp; constant mind chatter. We might even feel paralysed to take action towards our ideal life. And this has nothing to do with us, it's the mind repeating excessively and draining our energy and focus. Only if we could learn a method to put an end to this.</p><p>This course is designed to do just that. I am Aman Varma, Counseling Psychologist and a man who has a business, social life and so many things going on that occasionally I will worry just like you. In the past, I had developed an Anxiety disorder and excess worry issues. I recovered from them and decided to share my insights as well as a CBT psychotherapy-based plan to overcome worry &amp; anxiety. In this course, I share with you a step-by-step plan to put an end to this burden and live mental light. </p><p>'Worry' is the epitome of non-productive distress, because although it is by definition distressing, it also impairs the person's ability to resolve any problems that realistically underlie the worry. </p><p>Anxiety is one of the most common mental and emotional health issues globally, which we\u2019ve been trying to alleviate for a long time. Fortunately, we have Cognitive Behavioural Therapy. CBT is the most evidence-based (proven by science) approach to help people deal with their anxiety challenges and allow them to live the life they want. CBT is one of the most commonly used approaches to tackle anxiety. Psychologists, therapists, and counsellors with appropriate training use it regularly in private practice and the NHS to help people deal with many mental health issues, including anxiety. CBT operates by focusing on how we think and how this, in turn, affects our feelings and behaviours.</p><p>After learning this course you will be able to apply some of the techniques by yourself whenever you find yourself worrying. Understand and develop the necessary skills to overcome worry &amp; anxiety and once again live a stress-free life. rather, a life without unnecessary stress! </p>",

            "description": "<p>The central goal of Buddhism is to initiate a transformative process that would help people become less capable of perpetrating suffering, stress, and sickness of the mind. The Lord Buddha diagnosed the sickness (suffering), identified its cause (the original cause of suffering), explained that the sickness was curable (the cessation of suffering), and showed the way to treat the sickness (the way leading to the cessation of suffering).</p><p>In this course, you will be introduced to the above in detail. I support the Buddhist core teachings with other religious/spiritual teachings to get a holistic understanding of our problems and their solutions. </p><p>All our life, we work hard to fulfil our desires. One dream fulfilled spawns another. We seek happiness, but for most of us, we think happiness comes with having more. Instead of being content with an ordinary, simple life, our vanity causes us to want more wealth, success, glory, power, and so on. Our ambitions are endless. But the truth is, more isn\u2019t necessarily better and it can have adverse effects. In the endless pursuit of our desires, we actually create much suffering for ourselves.</p><p>The Buddhist sutras tell us that people with many desires suffer greatly because they\u2019re constantly seeking self-benefit and gain. When we give rise to desire, we act in order to seek things. When we can\u2019t get what we want, afflictions arise and we suffer. We might get into arguments with people over what we want. We might tire ourselves out scheming to get what we want. Our efforts to fulfil our desires bring us much affliction. Those with few desires don\u2019t suffer like this.</p><p>If we want to get rid of our afflictions, we have to know their source \u2013 our desires. We can then get rid of them by being content. Contentment leads to spiritual riches and a sense of satisfaction and happiness with what we already have. With fewer desires, we can sleep soundly at night without worries. Our hearts can be at peace. After all, what do we really come into the world for? What is life really about? Only by turning toward the Dharma can we begin to understand life\u2019s true value and purpose. We can get perspective and see things in a positive light. A sense of gratitude will fill our hearts, and we\u2019ll know how to make use of our lives in the most meaningful way, by contributing to the greater good.</p>",

This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames, passwords,\u00a0credit cards and other sensitive\u00a0information.\u00a0<br><br>In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive, and eventually highlighted in red, bold colors on the address bar.\u00a0<br><br>It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time, money and energy to drive traffic to your website. Your users expect a secure browsing experience and will likely be deterred from using your page when they see such warning labels attached.\u00a0<br><br>There is a common misconception that securing a webpage over HTTPS requires expert server knowledge and is a costly and cumbersome process.\u00a0<br><br>The purpose of this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about HTTPS and SSL certificates. We start with the basics. Exploring the theory and definitions that will be useful in developing your understanding.\u00a0<br><br>From there, we dive into configuring a server on Digital Ocean and installing a free SSL certificate known as Let's Encrypt. We also explore setting up Cron Jobs on an Ubuntu server, to automatically renew your certificate periodically.\u00a0<br><br>After completing this course, you will easily be able to secure any web page using HTTPS and free SSL certificates.</p>",

But did you know that meditation and mindfulness exercises can also help those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resist the urge to give in to compulsions?</p><p><strong>The term 'mindfulness' is used to signify many different things, but in the world of cognitive behavioural therapy for OCD, it simply means paying attention to the present moment without judgment or analysis.</strong></p><p>The present moment is whatever is going on at any given time. This includes the presence of thoughts, feelings, and sensations, whether wanted or unwanted. The struggle of the OCD sufferer is one in which certain internal experiences (thoughts, etc.) are viewed as unacceptable, whereas others are allowed to pass by without critique. Mindfulness suggests a different perspective on the presence of these internal experiences, that they be simply noticed, not judged or pushed away.</p><p>Obsessing is the state of being stuck in the mind, being distracted by unwanted thoughts and feelings, but not feeling capable of returning from looking them without compulsions or judgments. One tool for developing the skill of coming back is meditation, in which you attend to an anchor (often breathing), notice when your attention has wandered, and then gently invite yourself back to your anchor. This skill can become more automatic and applied to the experience of intrusive thoughts in OCD.</p><p>At the core of mindfulness for OCD is identifying thoughts as simply being thoughts, not threats, meaning the content of the thought itself holds no intrinsic value. Similarly, if you suffer from OCD, you may have come to believe that feelings are facts, signs that your obsessions hold some important truths. Mindfulness challenges this by simply identifying feeling as feelings, experiences that can be observed as they pass through. A common metaphor for this concept is that of sitting on a train platform, watching trains go by without attempting to board them.</p><p>This course is created by Vyas Psychology Training Centre</p>",

This course will give you an in-depth understanding of machine learning and predictive modelling techniques using R.</p><p>Most courses only focus on teaching how to run the analysis but we believe that what happens before and after running analysis is even more important i.e. before running analysis it is very important that you have the right data and do some pre-processing on it. And after running analysis, you should be able to judge how good your model is and interpret the results to actually be able to help your business.</p><p><strong>What makes us qualified to teach you?</strong></p><p>The course is taught by Abhishek and Pukhraj. As managers in Global Analytics Consulting firm, we have helped businesses solve their business problem using machine learning techniques using R, Python, and we have used our experience to include the practical aspects of data analysis in this course.</p><p>We are also the creators of some of the most popular online courses - with over 150,000 enrollments and thousands of 5-star reviews like these ones:</p><p><em>This is very good, i love the fact the all explanation given can be understood by a layman - Joshua</em></p><p><em>Thank you Author for this wonderful course. You are the best and this course is worth any price. - Daisy</em></p><p><strong>Our Promise</strong></p><p>Teaching our students is our job and we are committed to it. If you have any questions about the course content, machine learning, R, predictive modelling, practice sheet or anything related to any topic, you can always post a question in the course or send us a direct message.</p><p><strong>Download Practice files, take Quizzes, and complete Assignments</strong></p><p>With each lecture, there are class notes attached for you to follow along. You can also take quizzes to check your understanding of concepts of machine learning, R and predictive modelling. Each section contains a practice assignment for you to practically implement your learning on machine learning, R and predictive modelling.</p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey-</p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 3 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of models - Fifth and sixth section cover Classification models and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R than Python. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. As compared to Python, R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, usage of R and Python has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Like Python, adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What are the major advantages of using R over Python?</strong></p><ul><li><p>As compared to Python, R has a higher user base and the biggest number of statistical packages and libraries available. Although, Python has almost all features that analysts need, R triumphs over Python.</p></li><li><p>R is a function-based language, whereas Python is object-oriented. If you are coming from a purely statistical background and are not looking to take over major software engineering tasks when productizing your models, R is an easier option, than Python.</p></li><li><p>R has more data analysis functionality built-in than Python, whereas Python relies on Packages</p></li><li><p>Python has main packages for data analysis tasks, R has a larger ecosystem of small packages</p></li><li><p>Graphics capabilities are generally considered better in R than in Python</p></li><li><p>R has more statistical support in general than Python</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>",

Fortunately, this course is designed to be useful for both beginners and experts.</p><p>Our course starts at the basics, such as <strong>how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free</strong>, and then moves through an in-depth analysis of the software.</p><p>The course is designed so learners can go from start to finish but also have the option of jumping to the most relevant parts of the course, using the course as a reference guide to fall back on as needed, a dependable and up-to-date reference guide.</p><p><strong>We have updated this course each year and plan on continuing to do so as long as learners find it useful</strong>.</p><p>Courses on how to use software become outdated fast unless instructors are committed to updating the material, as we are. We also show lectures using the prior software versions, which will be relevant if you use an older version.</p><p><strong>This course will include backup files,</strong> a great tool to jump ahead or rework a portion of a problem. The backup files allow learners to have the exact same data as the example problem, so they can follow the presentation and perform the task in an easy, step-by-step process.</p><p>The first part of the course will demonstrate how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free, download it, and install it.</p><p>We will then use the sample file provided by QuickBooks to learn how to navigate the accounting software, locate the most commonly used areas, and understand the relationship between data input and the final product of financial statements and related reports.</p><p>The sample file is an excellent tool for learning how to navigate the software because it already has data in it, allowing us to deconstruct the process of data input by going to the end result of financial statements and drilling back to the source documents used to enter the data.</p><p>We will analyze transactions by accounting cycle: vendor cycle, customer cycle, and employee cycle. The vendor cycle may also be called the payment cycle, purchases cycle, account payable cycle, or expenses cycle. The customer cycle may also be called the revenue cycle, sales cycle, or accounts receivable cycle.</p><p>The course will break down the flow of data input forms in each cycle and the impact of each form on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>In the next major section of the course, we will start a new company file, an essential process for learning how to set up the foundational accounting system components like the chart of accounts, service items, revenue items, and beginning balances.</p><p>Learners will enter two months of data input along with instructional videos, entering a wide variety of common transactions and analyzing the impact of each on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, learners will prepare bank reconciliations using demonstration bank statements, learning how to perform a bank reconciliation, why we reconcile, and what outstanding items are.</p><p>The course also has an extensive section on how to use bank feeds. Learners will learn how to connect to the bank, download bank feeds into QuickBooks, and add the necessary data to include the bank data into the accounting system to create financial transactions or verify transactions that have already been created. We will also cover how to use bank rules to make data input much faster and more efficient. The course will demonstrate data input using bank feeds for checking, credit card, and PayPal accounts.</p><p>Next, we will enter adjusting entries; entries used to adjust financial statement reports more closely to their accounting basis as of the end of the month or year. Common accounting basis includes accrual basis, cash basis, or tax basis.</p><p>Learners will also understand how budgets fit into the accounting process, what some best practices are to construct a budget, how to enter a budget into QuickBooks, and how to run budget reports.</p><p>The course also has information on more specialized topics like using account numbers, customizing forms, using class tracking, memorizing transactions, fixed asset tracking, tax mapping, and multiple currencies.</p>",

People might even confuse your social anxiety with coldness or apathy. You want to be there for people, greet them, have fun and be a part of the group, but somehow you always stay in the shadows.</p><p>Belonging to someone is one of the most basic needs we have. We want to belong, love, share, open up and cherish relationships. But there might be some reasons why you cannot do this. You see other people having no problem making friends, having fun and being easily a part of the group. You just wish you were better in some way so that you could easily mix with other people.</p><p>This is all understandable and the first thing is that nothing is wrong with you. There may be some reasons and events that caused you to be this way. In this course, we will explore those reasons, change our mindset, and cultivate some skills and within months you will be able to feel the richness and fulfilment that comes with having genuine relationships where you can be yourself.</p><p>Have you been rejected in past? or perhaps taunted upon making the smallest of mistakes? maybe the people close to you made you feel as if you are not needed.

It is oriented toward the most prevalent kind of CPTSD, the kind that comes from growing up in a severely abusive and/or neglectful family. In this vein, the course describes healing the damage that occurs when you suffer traumatizing abuse and abandonment. Traumatizing abuse and abandonment can occur on verbal, emotional, spiritual, and physical levels. Moreover, sexual abuse is especially traumatizing.</p><p>In this course, you will learn various techniques to recover and heal at emotional &amp; spiritual levels. This course acts as a self-help guide for people dealing with CPTSD along with their medications. This course is not a substitute for professional help. </p><p>You can take this course if you are a budding counsellor, psychology student or even a parent who wants to understand and help someone who is dealing with CPTSD.</p><p>This course is created by Vyas Psychology Training Centre</p>",

It includes self-image issues, difficulty managing emotions and behavior, and a pattern of unstable relationships.</p><p>With borderline personality disorder, you have an intense fear of abandonment or instability, and you may have difficulty tolerating being alone. Yet inappropriate anger, impulsiveness and frequent mood swings may push others away, even though you want to have loving and lasting relationships.</p><p><strong>Schema therapy</strong> can help individuals identify the thought and behavior patterns underlying and perpetuating mental health conditions. Dr. Jeffrey Young began the development of schema therapy in the mid-1980s after he found cognitive behavioral therapy to be less helpful for some individuals than others, particularly those with chronic characterological concerns. He combined concepts from Gestalt, object relations, constructivist, and psychoanalytic approaches into a unified modality that focused on the particular strengths of each method.</p><p>The first Schema Therapy Institute opened in Manhattan in the 1990s. A number of studies conducted with the approach found it to be a highly effective treatment for borderline personality, and research further developing schema therapy and demonstrating its efficacy continues today. More recently, schema therapy has also been combined with mindfulness meditation to form a more spiritual approach.</p><p>In this course, you will learn everything about how to treat Borderline Personality Disorder using Schema Therapy. We will cover the basics as well as some advanced practices for counselling clients and treating their mental Issues.</p><p>Course created by Vyas Psychology Training Centre.</p>",

For example, Marcus says that a man should live a life of Integrity. He does not share any method to help readers develop integrity. In this course, you will find worksheets &amp; exercises to develop integrity. This book is Marcus' journal where he processed his thoughts for himself. This book is his personal diary and because of that you will get a lot of great advice but you won't know how to implement that advice in your life. </p><p>Think of this course as an extension to the book \"Meditations by Marcus Aurelius\" which gives you exercises to implement that advice in your life effortlessly.</p><p>This course does not teach philosophy. The aim of this course is to give you practical tools to implement the advice of Marcus Aurelius. It simply facilitates you with a lot of personal development concepts and strategies which will help you understand this book in much more depth and be able to implement the advice in your actions.</p><p>In my experience, I have observed many people finding it difficult to act on any kind of philosophy. They get stuck in consuming information passively and fail to implement them to see actual results in life. People also prefer some exercise, structure and frameworks that simplify these philosophies. So this course is an action plan to implement what Marcus Aurelius is reminding himself of.</p>",

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>Why use R for Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind.</p><p>3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science.</p><p>4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This course offers a comprehensive guide to the foundations of Adobe Lightroom CC, with a primary focus on the Lightroom Print, Slideshow, and Web Modules. We start right from the basics, where we explore the Lightroom interface and creating an image catalog. From there students learn to configure catalog settings while using the import dialog and import file handling. In this section students also learn to work with metadata presets, and preferences related to import options. Once students have a handle on the foundations, the course takes an in-depth look into file formats and color space. Here, we demonstrate the importance of understanding various image compression types and the quality vs size trade off. We discuss RAW vs JPEG vs TIFF files, along with color space comparisons between sRGB, RGB and CMYK. Students also learn the concept of image resolution and the importance of pixel density in determining image quality.<br><br>In section three, we complete our overview of the Lightroom interface by showcasing a few more essential features. This includes a number of file handling options, interface preferences, identity plate configuration, and watermarking.<br><br>Once students have a firm handle on the foundations, the course transitions into exploring the Lightroom slideshow module. Here, students learn how to navigate the slideshow interface and create stunning slideshows from image collections using various slideshow templates. We also cover a number of tools to spruce up the overall look of a slideshow using text overlays, and embedded media objects such as music and video. Lastly, students will learn how to export a slideshow using various file formats and compression options. <br><br>After completion of the slideshow module, we dive into the print module. Here students will learn how to navigate the print module interface and setup print templates to produce studio quality images on both home and commercial grade printers. Students will learn important concepts such as soft proofing, page setup, layout style, custom templates, and print job configuration. <br><br>The last section of the course provides a quick guide to publishing image collections to the web, using the Lightroom Web module. We start with an overview of the interface before exploring various layout options and the color palette. We then move on to the appearance panel, and output configuration before demonstrating how to publish the gallery using various web file formats. <br><br>As you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off with Lightroom. It\u2019s also a great resource for both professional and aspiring photographers that are looking to take their existing photos to the next level.

Lyrebird is an AI research division within Descript, currently and the team is building a new generation of tools for media editing and synthesis that make content creation more accessible and expressive.&nbsp; Sounding to be a wow factor, this new neural voice cloning technology from Lyrebird (that is discussed in the course) synthesises the voice of a human from audio samples fed to it.</p><p><strong>What is Voice-Cloning and how this course can be the next big revolution in technology?</strong></p><p>Voice cloning corresponds to a few-shot generative speech modelling conditioned on the identity of the speaker.</p><p>Typically, cloning a voice requires hours of recorded speech to build a dataset and then use the dataset to train a new voice model. Each speaker\u2019s embeddings can be applied to synthetically voice a random utterance or phrase - to be intact, or even users can input their own texts and the&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;tool will voice them. This means the AI tool can voice words, sentences and phrases you have not even spoken at all, for that matter. But, this course depicts secrets that can in fact go a long way to change the world of sound for the better. no longer. New technology tools are on the rise and in fact - these groundbreaking Real-Time Voice Cloning Tools allow anyone to clone a voice from a set of audio samples.&nbsp;Some of these voice-cloning tools have recording capabilities in-built that you can use or leverage within the tool itself.</p><p><em>This course serves to be a game-changer this year and beyond as it allows you to replace recorded words and phrases with a synthesised speech that's tonally blended with the surrounding audio - once the audio samples that you fed to it are finalised. Isn't that information breathtaking?</em></p><p>Why wait?</p><p>Enrol now, get started today and evoke the brilliance of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence usage of voice cloning and TTS (text to speech) and be surprised like you never have been. </p><p><strong><em>This is the time for AI to rule the world of voice and beyond.</em></strong></p>",

Learning it today, gives you advantages tomorrow!</p><p>I\u2019m talking about digital transformation. In terms of customer communications in basically any meduim or big enterprises. And for small businesses, the most succesfull ones, they are already doing it in a modern way from the first day.</p><p>This transformation - it is a moving away from old way of communications, like phone calls, email, or even fax - to new way - whatsapp, facebook messenger, instagram direct messages, telegram - any messaging apps that people are using in their everyday life. And now they are starting to us\u0443 it to talk to businesses. To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.</p><p>And here lies the opportunity!</p><p>All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition. New channels on the one hand bring a lot of new possibilities, such as chatbots and artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, require a rebuilding of current business workflows.</p><p>For example agent\u2019s KPI in a contact centre based on whatsapp, is very different from a voice-based CC. And somebody need to know how to deal with it.</p><p>But the contact center is not the only place where apps like whatsapp are taking over. It affects pretty much every customer related departpent: sales, marketing and loyalty, support, customer experience, automation and online services.</p><p>So, Whether you plan to tie your career or business entirely to this feild, this knowledge will help you achieve your professional goals in a variety of ways. Because communication - is the essential part of business.</p><p>I started this journey seven years ago, when it was hardly even existed. Since then, I have worked with some of the world's biggest clients, such as Societe Generale, British american tobacco and others.

Which will be useful tool to any of your further projects.</p><p>And briefly about me.</p><p>You can call me Slava. For a last 7 years I\u2019ve been running chat platform startup.

            "description": "<p>Existential therapy focuses on free will, self-determination, and the search for meaning\u2014often centering on the individual rather than on their symptoms. The approach emphasizes a person's capacity to make rational choices and to develop to their maximum potential. Some practitioners regard existential therapy as an orientation toward therapy, not a distinct modality, per se. This type of therapy is often useful for patients who experience existential threat or dread when security and identity feel in peril.</p><p>Existential therapy is derived from the work of philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Soren Kierkegaard, wherein the nature of being human is a central philosophical problem. Other theorists, such as Martin Heidegger, have contributed to existentialism; and much later Otto Rank applied this philosophy to the healing process of therapy.</p><p>The existential approach stresses that:</p><ul><li><p>All people have the capacity for self-awareness.</p></li><li><p>Each person has a unique identity that can be known only through relationships with others.</p></li><li><p>People must continually re-create themselves because life\u2019s meaning constantly changes.</p></li><li><p>Anxiety is part of the human condition.</p></li></ul><p>Existential therapy can be useful in treating psychological concerns that are thought to result from an inhibited ability to make authentic, meaningful, and self-directed choices. Interventions often aim to increase self-awareness and self-understanding. Existential psychotherapists try to comprehend and alleviate a variety of symptoms, including excessive anxiety, apathy, alienation, nihilism, avoidance, shame, addiction, despair, depression, guilt, anger, rage, resentment, embitterment, purposelessness, psychosis, and violence. They also focus on life-enhancing experiences like relationships, love, caring, commitment, courage, creativity, power, will, agency, presence, spirituality, individuation, self-actualization, authenticity, acceptance, transcendence, and awe.</p><p>In this course we will cover the basics to existential psychotherapy along with its core models and how it can be used in day to day context as well as counseling.</p><p>This course is created by Vyas Psychology Training Centre</p>",

It does take a strategy though. The strategy lies in using the right software platforms and tools and that's where the Weebly Website Builder comes in handy.</p><p>Weebly is one of the biggest website builders with over 50m websites created. In comparison to many of its rivals, Weebly has always been more interested in enhancing the technology of its product than in running costly ad campaigns.</p><p><em>Did you know that the visual appeal and simplicity of a website contribute to 95% of a user's first impression?</em></p><p>This first experience is usually thought of as the home page when designing a website, and all users can see without scrolling. You get one chance to attract and inspire users to connect more with the elements in this space. (And in just a few seconds of their time.)</p><p>The features most consumers are searching for-and forming their first impressions include:</p><p><strong>Navigation: </strong>Is it easy to find details and see what the website is about?</p><p><strong>Headline</strong>: Is the message really appealing to me?</p><p><strong>Imagery:</strong> Are the photos (or videos) fascinating and captivating?</p><p>Weebly has all the answers to the above as it can help you create the most attractive websites in a drag-and-drop interface that even a non-coder can make the best use of. Even if you don't have a background in design, anyone can use the Weebly builder to build a great website. Simply pick a prototype now and bring the concept plan into live effect. The future of web design is here - thanks to Weebly.</p><p>The Weebly platform also does things really well when it comes to&nbsp;Search&nbsp;Engine Optimisation&nbsp;(SEO):</p><ul><li><p><strong>URL, Title tags &amp; Meta-Descriptions:</strong> You can customize them, along with Alt texts for images. This is especially important to rank your images on search engines.</p></li><li><p><strong>301 Redirects:</strong> You can control them to avoid broken links when a page URL or link has been changed. We know that Google deeply dislikes 404 pages.</p></li><li><p><strong>Image Optimisation:</strong> Weebly does a fantastic job of compressing the kind of images you upload. This improves speed, which stays as a boon for SEO.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keywords:</strong>&nbsp;One can add the site's main meta-keywords or what we call \"Tags\" from the settings page quick and easy to make your website findable. </p></li></ul><p><strong>How is this course different from the rest?</strong></p><p>This mind-blowing course focussed on<strong><em> \"Super-Fast Web Design using Weebly\"</em></strong>&nbsp;taught by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\", Mastermind \"Saranya&nbsp;Srinidhi\" and Marketing Expert \"Sai Manoj\" will showcase some of the most interesting ways to build a website with Weebly extremely quick and easy.&nbsp;What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at the various methods for adding pages, maps, videos to your website. Then we will showcase the ways to publish the site and see traffic analytics from your Weebly dashboard.</p><p>If you have the passion to learn, there is no time to waste.<strong><em> The course will be educative, informative, and practical at the same time.</em></strong></p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this incredible course and change your career as a web-designer forever. There are interesting, engaging, and new things to experience here, inside.</p><p>Lights. Camera.&nbsp;Action. Let's begin.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong><em>Ready to see how Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;will take over the fiction-writing world by storm?</em></strong></p><p>Welcome to experience <strong>\"RoboAuthor: Content Writing Automation - Part 5\"</strong>.</p><p>Computer-generated fiction might seem like a tipping point for artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI), but it could help us to understand the incredible world we live in and how technology has changed from time to time. The real issue of machine intelligence and literature is always compared with the potential of what human intelligence could do and machines cannot.&nbsp;This breathtaking course is all set to rewrite history proving that machine intelligence would finally equal the limits of human creativity and even go beyond the creative imagination that we have. </p><p>The notion of advanced robots with human-like intelligence dates back at least to 1872 with Samuel Butler and his novel titled \"Erewhon\". This stemmed from his earlier (1863) essay, \"Darwin among the Machines,\" in which he raised the concept of the evolution of consciousness among self-replicating machines that could replace human beings as the dominant species. Even within films such as 'Ex Machina' or 'Chappie', a single lone genius is the first to successfully create artificial general intelligence; real-world scientists find this impossible. Anyway, let's see what this course can do to your career and life as an author.</p><p>My name is <strong>Srinidhi Ranganathan</strong>. My fans fondly call me \"Digital Marketing Legend\". Teaming up with<strong> Saranya Srinidhi, </strong>I have put this unique training course<strong><em> \"RoboAuthor: Content Writing Automation - Part 5\" </em></strong>together to help authors write fiction amazingly fast and easy using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools or apps that have recently emerged in the competitive market. After learning this course, you should be able to work or team up with a computer and write fiction automatically. </p><p><em>Enroll now and let's starting booming the writing magic with this part 5 RoboAuthor Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;course.</em></p><p>There is no time to waste. There are interesting, engaging, and new ideas to experience here, inside for you to go mind-blown.</p><p>Lights. Camera. Action.&nbsp;Let's begin.</p>",

Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>public speaking</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this <strong>public speaking&nbsp;course</strong> takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards.

            "description": "<p>Apache Spark Started as a research project at the University of California in 2009, Apache Spark is currently one of the most widely used analytics engines. No wonder: it can process data on an enormous scale, supports multiple coding languages (you can use Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL) and runs on its own or in the cloud, as well as on other systems (e.g., Hadoop or Kubernetes).</p><p>In this Apache Spark tutorial, I will introduce you to one of the most notable use cases of Apache Spark: machine learning. In less than two hours, we will go through every step of a machine learning project that will provide us with an accurate telecom customer churn prediction in the end. This is going to be a fully hands-on experience, so roll up your sleeves and prepare to give it your best!</p><p><strong>First and foremost, how does Apache Spark machine learning work?</strong></p><p>Before you learn Apache Spark, you need to know it comes with a few inbuilt libraries. One of them is called MLlib. To put it simply, it allows the Spark Core to perform machine learning tasks \u2013 and (as you will see in this Apache Spark tutorial) does it in breathtaking speed. Due to its ability to handle significant amounts of data, Apache Spark is perfect for tasks related to machine learning, as it can ensure more accurate results when training algorithms.</p><p>Mastering Apache Spark machine learning can also be a skill highly sought after by employers and headhunters: more and more companies get interested in applying machine learning solutions for business analytics, security, or customer service. Hence, this practical Apache Spark tutorial can become your first step towards a lucrative career!</p><p><strong>Learn Apache Spark by creating a project from A to Z yourself!</strong></p><p>I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing.

It\u2019s been founded by the same team that initially started Spark, too. In this course, I will explain how to create an account on Databricks and use its Notebook feature for writing and organizing your code.</p><p>After you finish my Apache Spark tutorial, you will have a fully functioning telecom customer churn prediction project. Take the course now, and have a much stronger grasp of machine learning and data analytics in just a few hours!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Spark Machine Learning Project (Telecom Customer Churn Prediction) for beginners using Databricks Notebook (Unofficial) (Community edition Server) </strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this Data Science Machine Learning project, we will create Telecom Customer Churn Prediction Project using Classification Model Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and One-vs-Rest classifier few of the predictive models.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Explore <strong>Apache Spark</strong> and <strong>Machine Learning</strong> on the <strong>Databricks</strong> platform.</p></li><li><p>Launching <strong>Spark Cluster</strong></p></li><li><p>Create a Data Pipeline</p></li><li><p><strong>Process</strong> that data using a <strong>Machine Learning model (Spark ML Library)</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Hands-on learning</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Real time Use Case</strong> </p></li><li><p><strong>Publish the Project on Web to Impress your recruiter</strong> </p></li><li><p>Graphical&nbsp; Representation of Data using Databricks notebook.</p></li><li><p>Transform structured data using SparkSQL and DataFrames</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>Telecom Customer Churn Prediction a Real time Use Case on Apache Spark</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About Databricks: </strong></p><p>Databricks lets you start writing Spark ML code instantly so you can focus on your data problems.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Personal Branding</strong>.&nbsp;Imagine delivering an elevator pitch to an executive who holds the future to your dreams, and the person says \"sounds interesting, please call my office and schedule a meeting. I'd like to talk to you in more depth about this idea.\" Wouldn't it be great to know that you can entice anyone into wanting a meeting with you after just a 30 second conversation? Nothing will enhance your <strong>personal branding</strong> as much as the ability to communicate an elevator pitch in a concise and compelling manner.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; \tIn this How to Deliver an Elevator Pitch course you will learn the following:&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to craft a tight, focused elevator pitch&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to rehearse on video&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to appear confident and relaxed&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \t* How to make sure your message is interesting and memorable&nbsp; </p><p>*How to demonstrate excellent <strong>personal branding</strong></p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course is delivered primarily through spoken lectures. Because the skill you are learning is speaking related, it only makes sense that you learn through speaking.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThe skill you will learn in this class is not primarily theoretical or academic. It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself. Learning presentation skills is like learning how to ride a bicycle. You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now. You may have an opportunity to speak out as soon as tomorrow, so why waste another day worried that your presentation skills are not up to high standards. Please enroll today.&nbsp; </p><p>Course updated on July 30, 2015</p><p>There is a 100% Money-Back Guarantee for this course. And the instructor also provides an enhanced guarantee.</p><p>What others say about this personal branding course:</p><p>\"5 Stars!&nbsp;Despite having been a speaker for many years and taken several colleges, online and private lessons, I found myself drawn to listen to TJ Walker, and I am thrilled to learn from this master of communications! He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today's environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker's delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\"&nbsp;Debbie Tudor<br></p><p>What others say about the instructor:<br></p><p>\u201cTJ Walker's single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\" <em>Bob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television</em></p><p>\u201cTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\" <em>Stu Miller, Viacom News Producer</em></p><p>(TJ Walker's Media Training Worldwide) \u201cThe world's leading presentation and media training firm.\"<em>Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor</em></p><p><br></p>",

This will aid the students who have no prior coding background to learn and implement Analytics and Data visualization concepts to actually solve real-world problems of Business Analysis.</p><p>Let me give you a brief overview of the course</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 1 - Excel for data analytics</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the first section, i.e. Excel for data analytics, we will learn how to use excel for data-related operations such as calculating, transforming, matching, filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.</p><p>We will also cover how to use different types of charts to visualize the data and discover hidden data patterns.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 2 - Google Data Studio for Data visualization</strong></p></li></ul><p>The second section, i.e. Google Data Studio for Data visualization will cover everything you need to create insightful and dynamic reports using Google Data Studio.</p><p>We will learn how to use different types of charts to visualize the data and discover hidden data patterns. Along with this, we will also learn how to create dashboards and how to share the dashboards with your team</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 3 - Statistics foundations for business analysts</strong></p></li></ul><p>Then, in the third section, i.e. Statistics foundations for business analysts, we will start learning about the core concepts of Business Analytics i.e. probability and probability distribution. We will look at important probability distributions used in a business setting such as Normal distribution, Poisson distribution, Exponential distribution, Binomial&nbsp; distribution, etc</p><p>These concepts form the foundation of data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 4 -</strong> <strong>Statistical Decision making</strong></p></li></ul><p>Once we have covered the basics of probability, in the fourth section, i.e. Statistical Decision making we will discuss some advanced concepts related to sample testing i.e. hypothesis testing.</p><p>These are the concepts that differentiate a beginner from a pro!</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 5 - Optimizing Business Models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In the fifth section, i.e. Optimizing Business Models we will learn how to solve common business problems with the help of excel's data analytics tools such as solver, goal-seek, scenario manager, etc.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 6 - Preprocessing Data for ML models</strong></p></li></ul><p>In this section, you will learn what actions you need to take step by step to get the data and then prepare it for analysis, these steps are very important. We start with understanding the importance of business knowledge then we will see how to do data exploration. We learn how to do univariate analysis and bivariate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> </strong>outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation, and correlation.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Part 7 - Linear regression model for predicting metrics</strong></p></li></ul><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important.

            "description": "<p><strong><em>We all know that Java is the most in-demand programming language and probably 70% of coders are striving to learn it. </em></strong></p><p><strong>Java</strong> is a solid core language, by the way. It is an <strong><em>object-oriented programming (OOP)</em></strong> language. Further speaking, for those in favour of looking to learn and master <strong>Java</strong> first, we must realize the key factor. The key factor is that it teaches you to think like a true coder. As you'll <strong>learn</strong> the language, you'll also <strong>learn</strong> some key underpinnings of programming as well and this serves to be an added advantage.</p><p><strong><em>Moreover,&nbsp;Java</em></strong> is beginner-friendly - even though people are aware that Java is a statically-typed language. A statically-typed language means that your code will have to be checked for errors before it can be built into an app, by the way. Modern Java programs are now even more performant than the older ones. You really can find languages that initially are easier than <strong><em>Java</em></strong> - but learning Java has immense benefits.&nbsp;For example, Java developers are in high demand compared to other programmers (according to a popular job portal). </p><p>Java has its own unique value too - which means Java handles some of most of the complex details of the machine (computer) such as memory management, etc.&nbsp;Let's read further on what this incredible course will deliver.</p><p>This in-depth course covers all the most amazing concepts related to <strong>\"Java Classes and Objects\"</strong> in a theoretical and practical manner. Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi Ranganathan\"</strong> and Mastermind <strong>\"Saranya\"</strong> also strive to bring in new-age concepts or technology relating to Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;programming in the final video. For example, apart from the main portions, special innovative tools like converting voice-to-code and project-planning based programming tools are covered. </p><p>So, why wait?&nbsp;Enroll now and get ready to learn Java programming.&nbsp;Finally speaking, a programming language's ability to stay relevant in an utmost manner and survive also depends on whether the language is getting new updated stuff all the time, so clearly Java will continue in the journey of domination in the years to come.</p><p>All the best for your learning endeavours!!</p>",

The rapid speed of AI growth demonstrates that it is a groundbreaking technology designed to transform the way people use devices and conduct business: achievements in unmanned aerial vehicles, the ability to beat people in chess and sporting games, automated customer service, and analytical systems - of course. Talking about the business, development, or marketing field, for instance, it is worth noting that Artificial Intelligence does not apply in a pure form to real self-aware intelligence machines in this sense. Instead, it can be considered a generic term for the number of software powered by automation that is being used by developers of websites and smartphone apps. They include the recognition of images and speech, cognitive computing, automated processing, and machine learning - for that matter. </p><p>Speaking of AI&nbsp;in app creation, for many years, starting with Apple's Siri, AI has already been influential in app-creation and marketing growth. It has the ability to advance even further in the coming years. Retail giants such as eBay and Amazon have already shown the ability for AI mobile applications to thrive. With new developments in technology and evolving customer expectations, the production of AI-powered mobile apps is the new digital frontier for businesses.</p><p>Further speaking, the extension of AI technology has allowed mobile users to reposition the current user experience value benchmark - altogether. Users are beginning to demand more in-depth and customized mobile app results. The output that a typical Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based app creation tool can deliver is certainly remarkable and holistic.</p><p>This course is a beginner's course that is focused on <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in App Creation</strong>. It has been created by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\". We will look at a theoretical and practical approach to the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in the field of app creation and development. A&nbsp;few cloud-based apps or tools will be covered that will help you discover new and innovative ways to convert websites into full-fledged Mobile, Windows, or Mac&nbsp;apps too.</p><p>There is no kind of technical knowledge required by you to learn this and this itself signifies that this is an easy course you can opt for immediately. </p><p><em>So, enrol now, and let us explore a new adventure in the field of app creation.&nbsp;Time to boom. </em></p><p>All the very best for your learning.</p>",
