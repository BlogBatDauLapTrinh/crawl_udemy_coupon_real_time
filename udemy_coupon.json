When you can do both, you can do things that no one else can do and you will be a unique asset to your company.</p><p>There\u2019s a shift underway in large organizations, one that puts design much closer to the center of the enterprise. But the shift isn\u2019t about aesthetics. It\u2019s about applying the principles of design for a better user experience. This new approach is in large part a response to the increasing complexity of modern technology and modern business.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Most people don't think about how poorly designed everyday interactions are until they learn the principles of good design and user experience, many of which are not intuitive. You don't need to be born thinking about this stuff in order to become a successful designer, it's a skill that can be developed like anything else. Passion often follows knowledge and expertise.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In this course, I have explained the entire design process which when integrated into your product can create an amazing user experience. You will also learn to approach a problem in a systematic manner. Working in a series is the most important stage of the design process.

But when people found out how to game Page Rank, Google lost the ability to detect what was a good link and a bad one, which reduced their ranking algorithms effectiveness.</p><p>In 2012 Google made some crucial updates, to weed out shady black hat link building techniques and better determine quality links. They now place a lot of importance on link quality, as well as quantity, meaning where your link appears is just as crucial, if not more, as how many links you get.</p><p>Now Google regularly penalizes websites who use black hat techniques or over-optimise with low-quality link building. The value of certain techniques such as submitting your site to web directories has also fallen, due to being repeatedly overused.</p><p>Search engines use backlinks to find out about new web pages, which they then include in search results. They also use them to evaluate a page\u2019s ranking position within search results.</p><p>Even though there have been a lot of changes, links are still critical if you want to rank well on Google. But employing low-quality link building techniques is not only a waste of your time and effort - but it could also actively damage your website\u2019s ranking.</p><p>The bottom line is backlinks are still so vital to your visibility in search, they are Google\u2019s key ranking signal. It\u2019s <em>pivotal</em> to learn the most current white hat techniques that will help you acquire great backlinks, so keep watching as we show you what to avoid, and what to do in order to build high quality backlinks this year.</p><p><strong>What can Link Building do for you?</strong></p><p>Link building is important if you\u2019re looking to build relationships with people in your industry for two primary reasons.</p><ol><li><p>It can help you acquire valuable backlinks on highly relevant, popular sites, but it also aids you in making connections over the long term. When you contact an influencer, site owner, or blogger with a well-written pitch that demonstrates the value of linking to you, you make that all-important first contact with someone who can be incredibly influential in your niche.</p></li><li><p>Even if they don\u2019t say yes, the first time around, providing your pitch is polite and relevant, you\u2019ll have made that all-important first contact. Next time, they might well say yes, or they might even come to you.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Get the RIGHT kind of traffic</strong></p><p>Links are incredibly useful for boosting your referral traffic and if you get a backlink on a popular website in your niche, you\u2019ll likely see a significant increase in visitors. As the traffic will already be pre-screened for interest, if your link appears on a relevant site, rather than a more general one - it\u2019s more likely to convert.</p><p>Getting your content, products, or services in front of people who are interested is a superb way to up the value of your links. Even if they don\u2019t buy from you right away, you\u2019ve raised your profile to an ideal target audience. This is something you should always be looking to do if your goal is to boost your SEO and expand your business.</p><p><strong>Establish your brand authority</strong></p><p>Your link building strategy can also help solidify your brand authority, particularly if you create content that\u2019s relevant to what you offer, and valuable to potential customers.</p><p>If you have a sportswear e-commerce store for example and published a piece entitled <em>\u201cGo from couch potato to 10K runner in 6 months\u201d</em>, this would be extremely relevant to a significant portion of your audience.</p><p>There\u2019s three ways you can benefit here.</p><ol><li><p>First, you\u2019re attracting people to your brand, who\u2019ve searched for the terms your piece has ranked for. Now they know who you are and are more likely to consider you an authority on a subject they are interested in.</p></li><li><p>Secondly, you\u2019ll raise your site authority with Google if enough people link to your piece, which also helps to boost your search engine ranking.</p></li><li><p>Thirdly, you may make some sales, if you link smartly to your products in the piece, or at the end, or if you include offers placed well around your article.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What\u2019s a hyperlink made of?</strong></p><p>To comprehend properly how links work and how search engines read them, you first need to understand all the different parts of a hyperlink - and what function they play.</p><p><strong>There are four main parts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Anchor tag</p></li><li><p>Href</p></li><li><p>Anchor text</p></li><li><p>Tag closure</p></li></ul><p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at what these different parts do\u2026</p><p><strong>Anchor tag </strong>- This is the part of your link that opens your link tag and lets search engines know a link is included.</p><p><strong>Href</strong> - Href is short for hyperlink referral and is the text inside the quote marks that shows where your URL is pointed to. It basically tells your browser where it needs to head to, whether that\u2019s a web page, image, or a file.</p><p><strong>Anchor text</strong> - This is the visible text that people click on when they open your link. It\u2019s often formatted differently from the rest of the text surrounding it, typically with an underline or blue colour to show it has been clickable.</p><p><strong>Tag closure</strong> - This one\u2019s pretty straightforward, it\u2019s the part of your link that lets the search engines know it\u2019s now the end of your tag.</p><p><strong>How to get Links Google LOVES</strong></p><p>Your focus should be on acquiring links that will have a positive impact on your Google rank, and often the best kinds of links are the ones you never even asked for.</p><p>You get these types of links by consistently creating something of quality, whether that\u2019s informative content, a unique website, or a really great product or service. When you do this regularly, people notice - and they naturally want to link to you.</p><p>Though you should <em>always </em>be trying to achieve these kinds of organic links, you shouldn\u2019t sit around waiting for people to link to your site. Instead, actively help to raise more awareness of your brand and content by using a link building strategy that boosts your Google rankings.</p><p>While not all Google ranking factors are known, there are many which most experts agree have a definite impact on your search position. Start watching as we\u2019re about to reveal the most important Google ranking factors you need to be aware of when it comes to link building.</p><p><strong>We really hope you will love learning all about backlinks and how to build them!</strong></p><p>Ing.

It's about carrying all the suitable instruments and creating a little powerhouse of desire.</p><p><br></p><p>Suppose you're writing bullets for a fascinations book or a premium brochure. In that circumstance, you'll typically begin by examining the daylights out of your topic.</p><p><br></p><p>Legends like the bright direct response marketer \"<strong>Gene Schwartz</strong>\" would start reading a book numerous times, emphasizing key points and tidbits with each read. Then he'd ask his secretary or a typist to organize his notes (which would frequently add up to a 70-page manuscript!) Eventually, he'd organize the bullets and commence filling in the running text, completing the fascinations as they came to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Others have a negligibly different approach. Clayton's exemplary mate and seven-figure direct response writer, Parris Lampropoulos, start by scanning through his analysis and writing as many as 800 fascinations. Talk about discipline! He'll likely only maintain about 100 of them at the most. Still, Parris likes to have approximately eight times more than he could ever utilize.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an elite system because it ensures that every bullet or desire that makes it into the final draft is impressive. He selects precisely from the \"cream of the crop\" rather than some useful ones and a ton of tolerable ones. (I'm sure you've noticed this issue \u2014 specifically online \u2014 where you're reading a long line of bullets, and 3 out of 4 are passable, at best. You can gamble that the writer didn't note seven times what he required and then pick his best!)</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at Parris's writings, I witness how this offers him many mixtures in his bullet sections, making them more fascinating and satisfying to read. This is paramount\u2014 especially in promotions implicating many fascinations \u2014 because even just one or two imperfect ones can cause your reader to begin \"skimming.\" Occasionally, a few horrible bullets can get your copy dumped!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Remember, \"your NUMBER One MISSION as a direct response MARKETER is to keep your Ideal CUSTOMER READING!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As you know, the essential purpose of copywriting is to CONVERT A CUSTOMER TO MAKE THE SALE. And, without question, the most reasonable way to do so is to keep your Ideal customer reading.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever witnessed when you're reading sales copy\u2026 if you read or research a good one from beginning to end\u2026 Do you start sensing that you DESIRE the product? That's the enchantment of a long copy! But it ONLY functions if you MAINTAIN your prospect's interest and curiosity to the end.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why Clayton frequently debates systematically about weeding out \"ineffective associations\" in your text\u2014 because weak connections push you to lose the reader's attention. And eventually, cause you to lose sales. Because they're so comfortable to read, bullets can be the most harmful of weak links.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why, if you bore your ideal customer with impotent or redundant bullets, the best-case strategy is that he begins flipping and scanning (the contrary to what you desire). This is one step from placing the letter down or tossing it in the garbage.</p><p><br></p><p>So you want to create and change your bullets, so your copy has a natural flow and doesn't seem fake. This signifies that some bullets need to be long, others short, some bullets blind, and others where you disclose the complete secret your ideal customer can directly benefit from.</p><p><br></p><p>Reading bullets should provide your prospect with a thrilling sensation. Almost like he's on a roller coaster adventure and doesn't predict which way he's going to be turned next.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can keep your prospect reading through a long string of high-quality bullets and fascinations, your possibilities of making the sale rise exponentially!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to CRUSH \"headline block\" for REAL</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And here's another compelling benefit you'll obtain when you become a terrific bullet and fascination writer. Having an army of killer bullets and fascinations in your possession gives you a slew of outstanding headline opinions and opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the finest writers in the industry will often begin their writing approach with bullets and fascinations.</p><p><br></p><p>That way, when it's time to compose the headline, you've got dozens \u2026 if not HUNDREDS of great potential options for an incredible headline.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the more current models of a winning headline that started as a bullet is from the control for Bottom Line Personal: \"<strong>How Doctors Stay Well While Treating Sick People All Day.\"</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was simply the most fascinating, benefit-based bullet out of hundreds reported by the package's author. If you see, it also indicates \"<strong>credibility</strong>\" because it mentions doctors. (We'll examine the demand for evidence and credibility in your bullets more in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>To work the same magic in your script, just write LOTS of bullets concealing every shocking, captivating, and emotionally touching amount of data you hold. When you've finished, you'll have at least a few awesome headlines \u2014 presumably at least 1-2 GREAT ones!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": ""}, null, null, null, {"course_id": "4604224", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Science", "title": "Climate Change explained: Causes, consequences and solutions", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Green Courses", "duration": "null", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "42", "students": "5082", "coupon_code": "597DF7A75D6963FC1B29", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/climate-change-explained-causes-consequences-and-solutions/?couponCode=597DF7A75D6963FC1B29", "expired_date": "2022-09-06 17:07:00+00:00", "headline": "Understanding how global warming and climate change are affecting our lives.", "description": "<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>In this course, we will address the climate change phenomenon from many angles and we will discuss its causes, consequences, and solutions.</p><p>Greenhouse gases are the reason behind this phenomenon.

When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "3728112", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Programming Languages", "title": "Project Development Using JAVA for Beginners - 2022", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Hemanth kumar", "duration": "null", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "2083", "students": "214492", "coupon_code": "4810B25AF6C164F09A17", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/project-development-using-java-for-beginners-2020/?couponCode=4810B25AF6C164F09A17", "expired_date": "2022-09-10 05:32:00+00:00", "headline": "Learn Java from scratch and become Software Engineer.", "description": "<p>Would you like to learn real world programming skills that will help you get your first java programming job?</p><p>Java is one of the most popular programming languages used to create Web applications and platforms.

The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries.

This could be the first step to a new high-paying job and an AMAZING career. If you\u2019ve been around the block a few times, consider taking a moment and answering some questions from newer techies. After all, it\u2019s our great community that illuminates the material and helps build something great.</p><p><strong>What Should You Know Before Studying The AWS Certified Database - Specialty?</strong></p><p>Every exam and certification has different requirements. If this is a serious venture, make sure to read the prerequisites before preceding. Nothing is worse than wasting months studying for an exam you can\u2019t take or passing an exam that won\u2019t help you get a certification! Our easy search tools are designed to help you find relevant information as well and search for a variety of different exams.</p><p><strong>What Is The AWS Certified Database - Specialty Focused On?</strong></p><p>The AWS Certified Database - Specialty or as it\u2019s also known, the <em>AWS Certified Database - Specialty</em>, like all tests, there is a bit of freedom on Amazon's part to exam an array of subjects. That means knowing the majority of AWS Certified Database - Specialty content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the AWS Certified Database - Specialty but it may take some extra work.</p><p><strong>Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day</strong></p><p>Remember that incredible things take time.

It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll get personalized help unheard of on test prep sites, without the outrageous fees.</p><p><strong>Always Check The Foundation</strong></p><p>Some certifications have requirements going back to older exams, while others use two or more tests to help someone pass. If you find the AWS Certified Database - Specialty is over your head, that\u2019s ok. It might make sense to see if a lower level exam will give you some clarity.</p><p><strong>If Offered, Read The Exam Objectives</strong></p><p>The exam objectives are different for every single exam and usually provided by the certification provider. These normally tell the test taker what subjects are relevant, what they need to know, and why the exam seeks to cover these topics. It\u2019s important to find them out for your specific exam. This can be found on nearly every vendor website and greatly informs the way you\u2019ll study! Don\u2019t worry though, we have taken those objectives into account and seek to create a testing experience comparable to an actual exam.</p><p><strong>Remember That Certification Is Quite Rewarding</strong></p><p>It can be hard to keep your focus on studying but remember that the best jobs in the world are only a few tests away. Whether you enter Cyber Security or do entry level tech work, certification is a clear, learnable, and rewarding path to careers that pay a LOT of money. They offer better work-life balance and you\u2019ll get in with some of the major leaders in the business world.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \"supported for critical security issues only.\" Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beginner Friendliness</strong></p><p><strong>Easy to Get Started With</strong></p><p>PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don't understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.</p><p>The latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.</p><p><strong>Flexible</strong></p><p>PHP is a dynamically typed language. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, PHP is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, null, {"course_id": "4828756", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Facebook Ads + Whatsapp Ads Marketing (CASE STUDY) HIndi", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yasir Ahmed, M.B.A", "duration": "null", "rating": "5.0", "reviews": "2", "students": "904", "coupon_code": "310822A", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/facebook-ads-whatsapp-marketing-yasirahmedmba-2022-2023-2024-2025/?couponCode=310822A", "expired_date": "2022-09-05 18:06:00+00:00", "headline": "Run facebook marketing ads to get leads on whatsapp with paid advertising in hindi/urdu", "description": "<p><strong>Complete case study of&nbsp; that got 20X ROAS for my business.

I was young, broke, and all I had was a dream, all I needed was the information and guidance.</p><p>As times changed, I had to adapt to constantly changing technology. I learned a lot about filmmaking from the Internet, but there was one thing that I couldn't find online, and that is how to actually make my own film. A real film, a feature film. A film that I can share with the whole world. A film that I can watch on TV. I needed to find a way to make a film without relying on people donating their money for my film or without hurting friends and family by asking them to help me make my film.</p><p>So that's what I did.

We can construct an&nbsp;accounting system where we record every financial transaction using debits and credits in a general journal, posting each journal entry to the general ledger, making the trial balance form the general ledger, and the financial statements from the trial balance. The process of recording every transaction using debits and credits is the process we have used in the past.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>To reduce the amount of data input when using a manual system, we can group transactions by transaction type and create special journals to record them. An accounting system using special journals can reduce data input by limiting the amount data needed to be input for each transaction due to the format of the special journal. Special journals can also eliminate the need to post each transaction to the general ledger. Rather than posting each transaction to the general&nbsp;ledger special journals are added up at the end of the period and one transaction is then posted for the entire period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Special journals are typically used in a manual system but understanding them helps any system because it helps to see what components of an accounting system are necessary to all accounting systems, which components can be changed, and when changing the format of the system would be beneficial. Automated systems also often general useful reports in a similar format as the special journals.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable and accounts payable are necessary&nbsp;for any system where we make&nbsp;sales on account and purchases on account.

There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Individuals often need to make similar decisions and can apply similar tools when making decisions of a large dollar amount that can affect multiple years.</strong></p><p><strong>Although the specifics of each decision differ, the concept of relevant costs helps us put together a process for gathering and analyzing data, picking up the information that matters, and removing all the excess data that does not matter to our decision.

For example, a hotel may have an incentive to take a \u201cspecial offer\u201d to sleep in a room for a night at a price far below the standard rate and even below cost as it is generally calculated. We will discuss why, and how this concept applies to business in general.</strong></p><p><strong>We will apply the concepts of relevant costs to a \u201cmake or buy\u201d type decision.

We're going to talk about the history and go over the IEEE 1584-2002 version up to the 2018 version. And there are the 16 years of rich history that's extremely important to understand where we are today with the 2018 version and some of the changes.<br><br>Furthermore, we're going to talk about a lot of different changes in the IEEE-1584 2018 standard. There are different busbar electrode combinations, there's a different voltage range and conductor gap information, there's information about the box, the height, the width, and the depth, and how they use that enclosure box to calculate the instant energy levels. There's the arcing current variation corrective factor that goes into a lot of detail, there is arc flash test, the continuous voltage spectrum, the enclosure size and correction factor, the table of equipment and class types, the minimum arcing current adjustments, and the 125 kVA transformer cutoff whatever happened to that, so we'll talk about that as well. Grounded versus ungrounded systems, the two-second rule cut off where that is, and as well as what's next? what goes above and beyond this 2018 standard?<br><br>So, stick around you'll expect to learn a lot from this standard and from this course.

There is a lot of flexibility for net income allocation in a partnership, and this is one of its primary benefits. </strong>  </p><p><strong>The course will cover the recording of partnership draws, how to record them, as well as the closing process for a partnership. The steps of the closing process will be much the same as those for any business entity except for the allocation of net income to the partners. </strong>  </p><p><strong>We will consider the situation where a partner leaves a partnership or where a new partner is added. The transactions related to a partner leaving or being added is unique to a partnership entity. </strong>  </p><p><strong>The course will cover a partnership liquidation process or closing process. The liquidation process is a very useful exercise for any entity because it allows us to do take apart a business. We have discussed the process of putting new busses together in prior courses, but to fully understand how something works we must also take it apart. The liquidation process is particularly important for a partnership entity because it emphasizes the capital accounts and the process necessary to reduce the likelihood of problems during the process. </strong>  </p><p><strong>We also include a comprehensive problem designed to take a step back and consider all the similarities between business entities so that we can put the differences we have studied in this course into perspective.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report.

Once the balance sheet balances have been constructed traditional accounting software will compare our book balance to the institution balance using tools such as bank reconciliations.</p><p>This course will cover how to access the Money in Excel template and connect it to financial institutions, downloading financial data.</p><p>We will work through a practice problem, imagining we are a small business wanting to construct an income statement needed for our income tax preparation at year end, income tax reported on a Schedule C Profit or Loss From Business Form. As we work the practice problem, we will compare the process to what may be done using traditional accounting software like QuickBooks.</p><p>We will then investigate construction of a personal balance sheet using Money in Excel, comparing how the process may be done using traditional accounting software.</p><p>The course will also cover other functions provided by Money in Excel including budgeting options and recurring transactions.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4665880", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Get 10,000 facebook page followers at cheap Hindi/Urdu", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yasir Ahmed, M.B.A", "duration": "null", "rating": "3.8", "reviews": "8", "students": "2771", "coupon_code": "310822A", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/10000-facebook-page-followers-cheap-yasirahmedmba/?couponCode=310822A", "expired_date": "2022-09-05 18:07:00+00:00", "headline": "Get Facebook Page Followers easy following my strategies", "description": "<p><strong>This training is in Hindi/Urdu,</strong> learn How to get Page likes on Facebook page for cheap as low as 0.20 PKR .<br></p><ol><li><p><em>2000 Page Likes At Cheap Cost Strategy</em></p></li><li><p><em>Strategy Multiple Creative Testing</em></p></li><li><p><em>How to evaluate performance of multiple creatives</em></p></li><li><p><em>Smart targeting approach to get good audience</em></p></li><li><p><em>How I Grew My Personal Brand Page to 25K followers</em></p></li><li><p><em>Simple Trick To Reduce Ads Cost (Works with all objectives)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Fan Page Followers For Monetization ( 20 CTR )</em></p></li><li><p><em>How To Sell Through Page Likes (My Shoe Business)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Testing Multiple Ad Copies</em></p></li><li><p><em>Successful And Failed campaigns Overview</em></p></li><li><p><em>How to get 10,000 followers cheap</em></p></li><li><p><em>3 Countries For Cheap Page Likes (0.25 Paisa)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Getting 15,000 Page likes For A Client (0.35 Paisa)</em></p></li><li><p><em>Get More Facebook Page Followers And Likes With This Strategy</em></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why You Should Join This Training: <br></em></strong>Doesn't matter if you are an absolute beginner or just someone who clicked.

You may also use another spreadsheet software like Google Sheets.</p><p>Learners will learn how to navigate Microsoft Excel as well as how to create a well-designed accounting worksheet, complete with a general journal, trial balance, general ledger, subsidiary ledgers for accounts receivable, accounts payable, &amp; inventory, financial statements and much more.</p><p>Excel is a very good tool to learn accounting because it is much more transparent than a database program, like accounting software, QuickBooks being a common example of accounting software.</p><p>As we enter transactions into our Microsoft Excel worksheet, we will discuss how the data input would commonly be entered into accounting software like QuickBooks and what data input forms would normally drive the transactions.</p><p>The course will start out from a blank Excel Worksheet. We will build the outline for our accounting system from the blank spreadsheet.</p><p>For each new step in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps being completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.</p><p>Therefore, you can complete the entire problem starting from one blank spreadsheet, or you can jump forward in the problem and rework any component of the problem by downloading the related worksheet at that point in the process.</p><p>After constructing the outline of our accounting worksheet, the first section will discuss the most common accounting transactions and the data input form often used in accounting software, like QuickBooks, to enter them, common data input forms including invoice, bill, deposit. . .</p><p>We will then start our comprehensive problem, constructing a new Excel worksheet and entering beginning balances into it, imagining that we had a prior accounting system which we are now converting to our new accounting system in Excel.</p><p>We will then enter two-months worth of data input. When entering the accounting data we will create the journal entry, post it to the trial balance, giving us a good look at which accounts are impacted, post to the general ledger, and make adjustments to any subsidiary ledgers needed. </p><p>We will also update the financial statements periodically.</p><p>For the second month of operations, we create a bit more complex trial balance, allowing us to calculate both the year-to-date numbers, including both months of data input, and the current period numbers, showing income statement accounts for just the second month of operations.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, we will process two bank reconciliations, using mock bank statements. As we construct our bank reconciliations, we will discuss how accounting software often accomplishes this task.</p><p>Next, we will adjust our worksheet to enter period end adjusting journal entries as well as reversing entries. For each adjusting entry we will consider the reasons for it and how to set up the accounting system so that our adjusting entries do not mess up the data input process in the accounting department.</p><p>After entering the adjusting entries we will construct our financial statements.</p>", "preview_video": ""}, {"course_id": "4618360", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Dropshipping Shopify Store Creation like  Boss for Ecommerce", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yasir Ahmed, M.B.A", "duration": "null", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "7", "students": "7025", "coupon_code": "310822B", "preview_img": "null", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/dropshipping-shopify-store-creation-like-boss-for-ecommerce/?couponCode=310822B", "expired_date": "2022-09-05 18:08:00+00:00", "headline": "Hindi Design Your Shopify Dropshipping Store like a pro.", "description": "<p>After joining this training you will be able to find winning products for dropshipping through research skill and techniques i have shared inside the training. <strong><em>(This training in Urdu/Hindi only enroll if you understand the language)<br><br>Topics:</em></strong></p><ol><li><p>Shopify Deep Understanding</p></li><li><p>Store Design Essentials</p></li><li><p>Store Building (Live)</p></li><li><p>Uploading and Optimizing Products</p></li><li><p>Images Graphics and Designing</p></li><li><p>Setting up Product Reviews</p></li><li><p>Setting up Upsell Products</p></li><li><p>Order received and Placing order on CJ</p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Why You Should Join This Training: <br></em></strong>Doesn't matter if you are an absolute beginner or just someone who clicked.
