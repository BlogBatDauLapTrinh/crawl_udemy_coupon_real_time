The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4391922/preview/?startPreviewId=37808260", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3402992", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Network & Security", "title": "Security + Practice Test", "content_length": "0", "level": "All Levels", "author": "OZ Education", "rating": "2.9", "reviews": "69", "students": "21829", "coupon_code": "8DE560E91043C3E9105F", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3402992_bcbe.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-security-sy0-501-k/?couponCode=8DE560E91043C3E9105F", "expired_date": "2022-10-07 23:25:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "632", "headline": "500 questions with accurate answers", "description": "<p>Security + SY0-601</p><p><br></p><p>500 questions with accurate answers</p><p><br></p><p>The Security+ certification, part of the organization's suite of certifications, provides an entry level certification for security.[1] The Security+ certification is widely considered one of the top entry level certifications because of it's low cost, comprehensive content, and worldwide recognition.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \"supported for critical security issues only.\" Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beginner Friendliness</strong></p><p><strong>Easy to Get Started With</strong></p><p>PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don't understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.</p><p>The latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.</p><p><strong>Flexible</strong></p><p>PHP is a dynamically typed language. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, PHP is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3950826/preview/?startPreviewId=35940996", "language": "Arabic"}, {"course_id": "4750792", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "poultry farming Broiler farming crash course", "content_length": "221", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Mohamed AL ashram", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "17", "students": "3569", "coupon_code": "77D671963223F3FCF758", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4750792_a09c_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/poultry-farming-broiler-farming-crash-course/?couponCode=77D671963223F3FCF758", "expired_date": "2022-10-07 20:33:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "369", "headline": "Broiler farm management profit extra income", "description": "<p>Prior to placement, commercial broiler farms should be prepared to receive new chicks. If litter has been recycled, it may be turned, treated, and/or otherwise managed to reduce ammonia, pathogen ,and insect load. Houses will be heated to provide adequate temperature for the chicks and feed and water lines may be primed so that they are at room temperature prior to placement. Temperature maybe uniform within houses or a temperature gradient may be provided to allow chicks to better</p><p>adjust their individual temperatures. If a temperature gradient is provided, feeders and waterers should be placed so that birds can adjust their temperature and still have easily access to feed and water. In general, chicks are placed at a ground temperature of approximately 90-95\u00b0F (32.2-35\u00b0C) and temperature is decreased as the birds age at approximately 5\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C)/week until the temperature is around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). However, this greatly varies based on the management system and breed of bird so temperature should be adjusted based on flock behavior . Many commercial broiler houses have some or extensive environmental control and the ability to implement standard program flock profiles for temperature and ventilation. Chickens in these environments Temperature &amp; ventilation Uniformity of ventilation is ideal to improve flock performance. Poor ventilation may pro-mote excessive litter moisture and increase the exposure of the chickens to enteric pathogens. Poor ventilation may cause excessive ammonia levels, which could be detrimental to the health and welfare of animals and employees&nbsp; Excessive ammonia at the level of the chicks may be less detectable to a standing human and high levels can cause health problems such as corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, and inflammation/deciliation of the trachea thereby predisposing birds to respiratory pathogens. Broiler processing Based on market needs, broilers will be processed at a target weight or age determined by the individual company. Loading chickens into transport vehicles to move to processing may be done at night or early morning to decrease physical and heat stress during loading. At the processing plant, misting or fans may help keep birds cool and reduce mortality while birds are waiting to be processed. In colder regions, heating systems may be needed. Handling of birds at processing, including unloading and shackling, should be done in a way to minimize trauma to the birds, which would not only be a welfare concern but would lead to increased condemnations. Birds should be rendered unconscious and/or euthanizedin a manner that does not cause undue stress, increase condemnations, or adversely affect food safety.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4750792/preview/?startPreviewId=42420922", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4054024", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "No-Code Development", "title": "Learn Elementor & WordPress, for Startups & Freelancers", "content_length": "161", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Nathan Minns", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "326", "students": "29981", "coupon_code": "23A3FB6B692FE2157BD5", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4054024_755e_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/beginner-to-expert-learn-elementor-wordpress/?couponCode=23A3FB6B692FE2157BD5", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 17:25:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "649", "headline": "Master WordPress and Elementor, from beginner to expert with free plugins and themes with this hands-on course", "description": "<p>Create an amazing website with WordPress and the world\u2019s best page builder, <strong>Elementor</strong> (and <strong>NO CODE</strong>)!

In this course I'll be sharing case studies you can copy that illustrate the power of lead ads.</p><p><strong>Lead ads Make it easy for potential customers to connect with your brand.<em> </em></strong></p><p>They make customer engagement a breeze, which in turn encourages more sign ups as when a person clicks your Lead ad on Facebook or Instagram, they'll see a form that's pre-filled with the contact details they've opted to share on Facebook, like their name and email address.</p><p>This makes people much more likely to respond as they don't have to do much work at all, making it super easy for you to capture a whole new audience. These types of Ads can be tightly targeted to ensure you<strong> reach the right audience and optimise your ad spend.</strong></p><p>When you enrol, I'll teach you how to make Lead Ads work for you, from initial set up, to selecting your target audience, and creating engaging ads using visual, video, and text content to attract customers magnetically.

Regardless of how much planning you intend to do, it\u2019s always worthwhile thoroughly planning out <em>this</em> part of your video.</p><p>To create a truly great first 15 seconds, you first need a \u201chook\u201d, which is something that will get people initially excited, so they want to stick around to watch what\u2019s coming next.

Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company. When you can do both, you can do things that no one else can do and you will be a unique asset to your company.</p><p>There\u2019s a shift underway in large organizations, one that puts design much closer to the center of the enterprise. But the shift isn\u2019t about aesthetics. It\u2019s about applying the principles of design for a better user experience. This new approach is in large part a response to the increasing complexity of modern technology and modern business.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Most people don't think about how poorly designed everyday interactions are until they learn the principles of good design and user experience, many of which are not intuitive. You don't need to be born thinking about this stuff in order to become a successful designer, it's a skill that can be developed like anything else. Passion often follows knowledge and expertise.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In this course, I have explained the entire design process which when integrated into your product can create an amazing user experience. You will also learn to approach a problem in a systematic manner. Working in a series is the most important stage of the design process. The ability to experiment, value and learn from mistakes, and build on the experience achieved is the hallmark of the truly successful and creative individual, whatever the field.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>So, what are you waiting for?? </p><p>Get Enrolled and start your journey today\u2026 </p><p>Happy learning my dear friends.

An object which will return data, one element at a time.</p><p>This is a brief and simple definition of Python iterator.</p><p>Let's go to the second section, which we will talk about.</p><p>In the second section we will talk about The Python scope Of all kinds and how to deal with them.</p><p>Not all variables or functions can be accessed from anywhere in a program. The part of a program where a variable or function is accessible is called its scope.</p><p>The section that next, we'll talk about the string formatting To make sure a string will display as expected . and You\u2019ll learn about these formatting techniques in detail and add them to your Python string formatting toolkit.</p><p>And in the fourth section we will know all about:<br>What generators in Python are and how to use them</p><p>How to build generator functions and expressions</p><p>How the Python yield statement works and the difference between yield and return.</p><p>How to use multiple Python yield statements in a generator function.</p><p>How to use advanced generator methods in your apps.</p><p>The section that next, you\u2019ll learn everything about regular expressions in Python.</p><p>This is a very important topic, and we will talk about it in a detailed and practical way and with deep clarification. Actually, You\u2019ll have all power of regular expressions, You will work with the re library, deal with pattern matching, and many more.<br>Basically, Regular Expressions are a tool for matching patterns in text. This is a brief and simple definition of Regular Expressions.</p><p>In the next section, you\u2019ll master the most commonly used data structures from the Python collections module. <br>Basically, Collections in Python are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, lists and dictionaries. These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python collections module.</p><p>The collections module is used to improve the functionalities of the built-in collection containers. </p><p>The next section walks you through how to package a simple Python project. It will show you how to add the necessary files and structure to create the package, how to build the package, and how to use this Package.</p><p>In the next section, you\u2019ll master all about math and statistics modules practically, and the functions that are used with them.</p><p>Simply, the math module provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard. and The statistics module provides functions for calculating mathematical statistics of numeric data.</p><p>Finally, In the last part of this course you will learn something very important, which is decoration.</p><p>In this section on decorators, we\u2019ll look at what they are and how to create and use them in detail.</p><p>Simply and By definition, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying it. that\u2019s it .

Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Instead, <strong>static analysis examines the file for signs of malicious intent</strong>. It can be useful to identify malicious infrastructure, libraries or packed files.</p><p>Technical indicators are identified such as file names, hashes, strings such as IP addresses, domains, and file header data can be used to determine whether that file is malicious. In addition, tools like disassemblers and network analyzers can be used to observe the malware without actually running it in order to collect information on how the malware works.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Analysis</strong></p><p><strong>Dynamic malware analysis executes suspected malicious code in a safe environment called a <em>sandbox</em>.</strong> This closed system enables security professionals to watch the malware in action without the risk of letting it infect their system or escape into the enterprise network.</p><p>Dynamic analysis provides threat hunters and incident responders with deeper visibility, allowing them to uncover the true nature of a threat. As a secondary benefit, automated sandboxing eliminates the time it would take to reverse engineer a file to discover the malicious code.</p><p>This course aims to point out the security essentials for any given IT organization. The course enables students to setup a secure base from scratch or review an existing security skeleton for their IT environments.

Sounds interesting?? Let\u2019s go ahead and learn what this is all about\u2026</strong><br></p><p>Let me ask you a few questions. Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey. Being a parent I know the toughest thing is to have your child express their feeling to you. We have covered this most important aspect of creative self-expression through different exercises and fun methods.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are you a Non Profit or Charity helping the world?</strong></p><p>Awesome!

Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you. What's more?&nbsp;This course will also contain the Google Ads dashboard walkthrough taught by Srinidhi and video advertising campaign creation steps along with the report-seeking process.</p><p>It's time to become a Professional YouTube Advertising Expert in the fastest time possible ever!</p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p><p>Enroll now and let's start the magic.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4549894/preview/?startPreviewId=39456050", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4580890", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "No-Code Development", "title": "WordPress Practice Tests & Interview Questions (Basic/Adv)", "content_length": "0", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Prince Patni", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "33", "students": "15250", "coupon_code": "SEP003", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4580890_0cb3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/wordpress-practice-tests-and-interview-questions-basic-advanced/?couponCode=SEP003", "expired_date": "2022-10-04 19:31:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "327", "headline": "Test & Improve your WordPress skills | All topics included | Practical exercises | Common Interview Questions", "description": "<p>WordPress is the perfect tool for creating a fully customized website for any purpose.

Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.</p><p>We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.</p><p>The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing.

Of course, listening and speaking were the core abilities that we were accepted to a primary school.</p><p>And we all know that none of us teach our children how to pronounce vowels, consonants and words like the lessons we get in a language learning school?</p><p>But how did we learn to speak and to understand what we hear when we were a child?</p><p>In my opinion, one of the reason is that we hear words many times. </p><p>When we hear the sound of a word many times, we will have enough sound information in our memory and then our brain will send the right command to our speaking organs how to produce that sound. Make sense?</p><p>Did you think about this, sometimes we pronounce a word wrong and somebody else tells us the correct spelling, maybe we can\u2019t pronounce that word correctly after hearing it once, but in most cases we will be able to pronounce that word correctly after 3-5 times we hear that word, and we are doing this just by hearing.</p><p>Sometimes we feel the need of a little bit of time, just after the full pronunciation of a word, to clearly identify that word. Why this happens is that, our brain trying to match the sound we heard with an existing sound information in our memory. But we did not put that sound information in our memory. In most cases we will be expecting the pronunciation of a word, just like we saw that word on a paper.</p><p>In this course we are going to use some digital tools to improve our listening experience and as a result of listening we are also going to improve our speaking skills. </p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/702338/preview/?startPreviewId=4872434", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4865402", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Finance", "title": "Personal Finance #4-Credit: Sources, Costs, Pros & Cons", "content_length": "461", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "2561", "coupon_code": "DE5A7881995DFE6FABF8", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4865402_6939_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/personal-finance-4-credit-sources-costs-pros-cons/?couponCode=DE5A7881995DFE6FABF8", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 03:35:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "707", "headline": "Learn about debt and credit related, personal finance decisions, from a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will focus on tools to help with personal financial decisions related to debt and credit.</p><p>Learners will understand the advantages and disadvantages of using credit, as well as the associated costs of using credit.</p><p>We will discuss credit-related terms like closed-end credit, open-end credit, and different loan types.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer <strong>Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994</strong>. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <strong><em>Personal Home Page</em></strong>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <strong><em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em></strong>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[9] and robotic drone control. PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the <strong>Zend Engine</strong>, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>W3Techs reports that, as of January 2022, \"PHP is used by 78.1% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know.\" PHP version 7.4 is the most used version.

And the two approaches are entirely distinct from each other.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>What do you mean by affiliate marketing?</strong></p><p>Affiliate marketing is about sending traffic to a merchant's website. The vendor will reward you with a commission if the individuals you send to their website buy anything they may sell.</p><p><br></p><p>Amazon is one such vendor with a top-rated profitable affiliate program.</p><p><br></p><p>Amazon - and its associates in different countries - will pay you commissions for sales you cause through your website's content.</p><p><br></p><p>For this to occur, you will require a site ranking high in Google and other search engines. These good rankings will mean people searching for products will visit your website from Google's search results, read your blog post or article- and hopefully click on your amazon affiliate link, go to Amazon and purchase one or many products.</p><p><br></p><p>Since people clicked on your affiliate link and landed on amazon, your website acted as a bridge funnel between Google and amazon.</p><p><br></p><p>And since you directed them to amazon, you will gain a commission for products they might purchase while on the website.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>You make websites, rank those websites on Google and other search engines, get traffic to your website - and send your site visitors to the merchants' site. In this case, the merchant is amazon. And you get a commission for every purchase.</p><p><br></p><p>But before you can create these websites that rank high on Google, you will need to learn SEO - otherwise known best as search engine optimization.</p><p><br></p><p>SEO is the process of obtaining organic - or what marketers like to call free - traffic from Google and other search engines such as Bing, Duckduckgo, Yahoo, etc...</p><p><br></p><p>Without proper knowledge of the different SEO methods and principles, you will not be capable of ranking your websites in search engines and getting organic traffic to your websites.</p><p><br></p><p>A large part of this course will explain details about SEO.</p><p><br></p><p>All elements of SEO are debated in this course - from the basics of SEO to advanced SEO concepts like silos architecture that can help your pages rank with barely any backlinks.</p><p><br></p><p>Here's a detailed summary of what is covered in this course ...</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Niche Research and decision making</strong></p><p>Before you create a website, you must understand which segment of people your website will target.</p><p><br></p><p>Usually, your affiliate website should target a distinctly defined niche. It just cannot be everything to everyone.</p><p><br></p><p>Since Amazon sells physical products, your niche has to have several products sold on the platform.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, several niche research ideas are discussed. By applying these ideas, you will efficiently and quickly be able to find lucrative niches that have hot products on amazon.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Keyword Research</strong></p><p>Once you have chosen plenty of niches that you find attractive, you will need to specify keywords within the place that you would like to target.</p><p><br></p><p>This is perhaps the most essential part of the fundamental SEO process. You will need to choose relatively easy keywords to rank - and can generate revenues if your site earns monthly payments.</p><p><br></p><p>Selecting significant keywords is an SEO practitioner's most critical task. It's essential that you target the proper keywords - or else no amount of SEO might be able to support you rank your site.</p><p><br></p><p>This course covers keyword research in significant depth.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Keyword research techniques to generate keyword ideas in just about any niche are debated in detail.</p><p><br></p><p>And then, you get to see how to assess keywords for the comfort of ranking and revenue-generating possibilities.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Once you have scanned these keyword research lectures, finding relevant keywords in just about any niche will be easy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Siloed Websites Architecture</strong></p><p>This is rarely examined in SEO and online courses, but this is a fundamental SEO notion.</p><p><br></p><p>With this architecture, you will have an easier time ranking your website on google.</p><p><br></p><p>Numerous SEO courses gloss over this concept or do not present it in an easy-to-grasp way.</p><p><br></p><p>This course explains silo architecture in boring depth - in a manner that is very straightforward to comprehend.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Complete Worked Example - Supplements website blueprint</strong></p><p>You will discover a complete work example in this part of the course.</p><p>You will learn how the keyword research and choice process works and how silos are created.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The niche site example</strong></p><p>While silos work very nicely, not everyone might like to create a siloed site. Most affiliate marketing sites are, indeed, niche websites.</p><p><br></p><p>This section examines niche websites and how to create niche sites that rank better on google using Ahrefs.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Choosing a domain name for your website</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step in the website-building process. Specific domain names may either support or impede your SEO efforts. All of these are discussed in this section.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Building the Wordpress website from scratch</strong></p><p>We use WordPress - the most popularly used CMS - to develop websites.</p><p>Almost everything you desire to learn about creating affiliate marketing WordPress websites is explained here.

You would need to back up your sites - and you would want to know how to restore your site in case something goes wrong to preserve the DATA.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wordpress website speed optimization using Free Plugins</strong></p><p>The faster your website loads, the more valuable it will be for conversions.</p><p>Your website needs to load as fast as feasible. Slow websites upset visitors and can damage your conversion rate.</p><p><br></p><p>This section will show you precisely how to make your WordPress website load fast.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>SEO 101 section</strong></p><p>SEO is not complicated, but it's a learning game.

That's one of the reasons why the digital web is increasingly becoming the backbone of video.</p><p>In hopes of expanding their following, creators convert their work into a video for YouTube, like young actors flocking to Hollywood for more exposure.</p><p>Podcasts have quickly gained prominence in just the last few years. Most of the main reasons for this was the transition to smartphones; customers switch away from desktops and more frequently use handheld devices. Also, search engines adjust their algorithms to offer mobile priority, making it more important than ever for organizations to concentrate on web or app optimization. As people rely more on mobile devices, viewing, uploading, and listening to podcasts has been simpler than ever, wherever and whenever. Another factor fueling podcasts' success is the lack of time for people. We appear to be busier than ever and the reality makes it impossible to calm down, read a book, or even watch a TV show without interruption.

platform - which means your target audience for <strong><em>B2B</em></strong> <strong><em>marketing</em></strong> is right there and ready to see what you are posting or offering. The <strong><em>benefits</em></strong> of <strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong> are almost endless - for that matter.&nbsp;There are so many opportunities there. There is no downside we can think of. </p><p>Recruiters and employers use LinkedIn to search for applicants, but the platform also reveals your credibility in your industry and highlights your accomplishments. You can even establish your expertise through this content platform, interact with your connections or fans via brand pages and groups, and of course - reach out to others through LinkedIn messaging. This will help in creating an impact.</p><p>LinkedIn offers you the opportunity to showcase your profile, knowledge, suggestions and connections in a meaningful way. The social network is just another tool from the viewpoint of a job seeker that you can use to help get ahead when looking for a new job.&nbsp;It boasts of extensive job-listings you cannot even imagine.</p><p>For research organisations and individuals working for them, LinkedIn is a brilliant social media network. You can use this to target individuals working for companies you really want to work for within your network.</p><p><strong><em>Have you mastered the art of LinkedIn marketing?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>If yes - then this short yet educative quiz course is for you !!</p><p>Each and every question in this brilliant quiz is thoughtfully written. It contains concepts on LinkedIn usage and certain marketing concepts to test your knowledge. The quiz also will provide explanations or feedback on the answers.&nbsp;This will help you improvise on the topic.&nbsp;Even if you got a few answers wrong here - do not worry. Mistakes are really the pillar stones to your learning.</p><p><strong><em>Sign up now and let's find out.</em></strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3728308/preview/?startPreviewId=30211954", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3686036", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Engineering", "title": "Functional Programming + Lambdas, Method References, Streams", "content_length": "122", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Andrii Piatakha", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "161", "students": "88262", "coupon_code": "0C19B8FCFF0D76EA7DF2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3686036_3cfd_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/functional-programming-learnit/?couponCode=0C19B8FCFF0D76EA7DF2", "expired_date": "2022-10-05 20:24:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "76", "headline": "Learn amazing features in Java with functional programming, lambda functions, method references and Stream API", "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Functional Programming in Java with Lambda expressions (anonymous functions), Method references, and Stream API. </strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you.

But how many of our respected personal relationships are marked by a lack of feeling? The best way to create those genuinely meaningful relationships we all want to have with our clients is to concentrate on making stories more personally resonant, situationally important, and emotionally intelligent. Greater empathy is the real key to every goal - we have (as content marketers, and as people).</p><p>Further speaking, we know that devising a content marketing strategy isn't very easy. It depends on numerous factors.&nbsp;First, the objective of the content has to be defined and the audience persona has to be created. Second, the headline or the title of the article should be captivating. Then, the content written has to be unique and the Call-to-Action (CTA) has to be super-actionable.&nbsp;Once all the above attributes are taken care of, the content article has to be marketed in the right target niche' platforms for viral growth. We should also not forget that the written content should appeal to the reader's emotions. It should evoke a sense of these universally recognisable emotions being:</p><ul><li><p>Surprise</p></li><li><p>Amusement</p></li><li><p>Joy</p></li><li><p>Contentment</p></li></ul><p>Content marketing demands consistency, always.

The court's mandate is to protect the Constitution, to settle disputes between the central government and the states, to settle inter-state disputes, to nullify any central or state laws that go against the Constitution and to protect the fundamental rights of citizens, issuing writs for their enforcement in cases of violation.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4226886/preview/?startPreviewId=35440878", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4719804", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Engineering", "title": "Debugging Bootcamp : Software techniques beyond windbg,gdb", "content_length": "255", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "RougeNeuron Academy", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "14", "students": "8082", "coupon_code": "C0ACA7460826CA879FAE", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4719804_6462_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/system-debugging-essentials-beyond-debuggers/?couponCode=C0ACA7460826CA879FAE", "expired_date": "2022-10-29 16:30:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "27", "headline": "Learn the fundamentals of debugging beyond your language skills in C++, Java, Python,Rust, Javascript, GoLang etc.", "description": "<p>Debugging is more than just attaching a debugger to a running program.

It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself.

And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your media presentation skills right now.

Taking the time to improve your communication skills can be highly rewarding. Being able to communicate more effectively will help you to build stronger relationships with the people around you, and get your ideas across successfully.</p><p><br></p><p>It can be especially difficult to communicate clearly in English if you have not been learning for very long. Even if you have memorised endless amounts of vocabulary, practised your grammatical skills to perfection and can read books entirely in English cover-to-cover, you still might struggle to express yourself. Read on for our top tips on developing your communication skills.</p><p><br></p><p>The English for Work course is designed to improve your English language skills and is tailored to your specific study motivations, language goals and needs.</p><p><br></p><p>Practise in your own time and at your own pace. You will get instant feedback to track your progress with engaging, structured online exercises that will help you improve your listening, reading, writing, grammar and vocabulary skills. There are online exercises to complete before and after every live class.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Slow down</strong></p><p>Don\u2019t expect to be able to speak as quickly in a foreign language as you can in your mother tongue. Take your time, and try to slow down your speaking speed. By speaking slower, you\u2019ll have more time to choose your words, think about your answers, and give the best possible response. Whoever you\u2019re trying to communicate with will appreciate that you\u2019ve tried to select your words carefully.</p><p><strong>Learn sentences instead of words</strong></p><p>When you learn a new word in English, take a couple of minutes to memorise some sentences that contain it. In the long run, this will go far in helping you with conversation and communication. It isn\u2019t unusual for language learners to know the meanings of words, but struggle to use them properly in a full sentence.</p><p><strong>Listen to others</strong></p><p>Pay attention to what\u2019s being said around you, even if you\u2019re not part of the conversation. Listening to native English speakers can help you to improve your own communication skills; you\u2019ll pick up on body language, intonation, and accents. When you\u2019re taking part in a conversation, let the other person speak without interrupting, and hopefully they\u2019ll repay the favour for you when you\u2019re talking.</p><p><strong>Ask questions</strong></p><p>Improve your communication skills by asking questions- it will help to show that you\u2019re interested in who you\u2019re talking to and what they\u2019re saying. Asking questions is the best way to keep a conversation going, and it will help you out too by making sure you\u2019re not the one that has to do all the talking. Here are a few examples that could come in handy:</p><ul><li><p>What do you think about that?</p></li><li><p>How about you?</p></li><li><p>Why do you think that?</p></li></ul><p><strong>Body language</strong></p><p>Your body language often reveals more than you think it does. You could tell your friend you\u2019re listening but have your eyes glued to your phone screen, or tell someone you\u2019re ready for a discussion but have your arms firmly crossed. Eye contact is also a big giveaway; making and maintaining eye contact is a big indicator of confidence. Think about the signals your body is giving off when you\u2019re talking to other people, and you might notice a change in how others perceive you.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4684662/preview/?startPreviewId=41304528", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2726536", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Taxes", "title": "C Corporation Income Tax (Form 1120)", "content_length": "318", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "134", "students": "21333", "coupon_code": "A7BF6B930857047F637D", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2726536_3f1c_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/c-corporation-income-tax-form-1120/?couponCode=A7BF6B930857047F637D", "expired_date": "2022-10-07 04:27:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "896", "headline": "Learn to enter tax data for a C Corporation into tax Form 1020 from a CPA", "description": "<p>This course currently consists of a comprehensive problem showing the data input process of a C Corporation into tax Form 1120.</p><p>This course will put together a systematic format of entering data into a Form 1120 that will minimize errors, isolate problems as they happen, and remove the possibility of having to start the process all over again.</p><p>We will enter each M-1 adjustment individually into both the tax return and an Excel worksheet so that we fully understand how M-1 adjustments function.</p><p>We will start by reviewing the data for the comprehensive problem.</p><p>Then we will enter the data into an Excel worksheet that will be used to help us organize the information.</p><p>We will be using Lacerte Tax software to enter the tax data into Form 1120.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1.

SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.&nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies. If not, the SEO strategy and action plan will have to be updated.&nbsp;You can always have an SEO checklist in hand, ready.</p><p>If you believe you already have all the knowledge, guidance and skills outlined above, then this ultimate search engine optimization&nbsp;(SEO)&nbsp;quiz created by the King of Digital Marketing<strong> \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</strong> and <strong>\"J. Selva Antony Santosh\"</strong> is for you!&nbsp;This quiz also has the room for explanatory answers that it provides. It may be a tough test for you, still.</p><p><strong><em>All the very best to score well!</em></strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3780556/preview/?startPreviewId=30736112", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4258716", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Game Development", "title": "Crea tu propio juego con Python", "content_length": "239", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "JOSE OJEDA ROJAS", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "236", "students": "38307", "coupon_code": "JOSECODEOCT22", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4258716_5620_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/crea-tu-propio-juego-con-python/?couponCode=JOSECODEOCT22", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 14:27:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "739", "headline": "Uso de la libreria Pygame para desarrollo de juegos con Python", "description": "<p>Mediante la libreria Pygame de Python podremos crear nuestros propios juegos con este lenguaje de programacion.<br>Python es un lenguaje muy versatil con el que podras realizar todo tipo de aplicaciones.<br>Recomiendo que estes familiarizado con este lenguaje, puedes ver mi curso de Python en Udemy o a traves de mi canal de youtube.<br>Usado tambien para analisis y visualizacion de datos, machine learning, deep learning, etc.<br>Hay una enorme comunidad apoyando este lenguaje con numerosos frameworks y librerias que nos facilitan mucho la programacion.<br>Tanto Python como los editores mostrados y usados en el curso son Open Source, se pueden descargar y usar libremente.<br>Los videos son totalmente practicos e iremos poco a poco avanzando con las estructuras basicas.<br>Si como estudiante estas adaptado a otros editores o navegadores, no hay ningun problema en usarlo.<br>Para cualquier duda no dudeis en contactar conmigo a traves de los diferentes canales y redes sociales, pasaros tambien por mi canal YouTube donde tengo numerosos tutoriales publicados sobre HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python...<br>En el canal YouTube podreis acceder a los diferentes contenidos a traves de las listas que he creado para categorizar&nbsp; los distintos tutoriales que he subido al canal.<br>Tambien podeis contactar via emal.<br>Espero os sea util el curso y que sea un buen comienzo en la Programacion de juegos, muchas gracias.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4258716/preview/?startPreviewId=35976538", "language": "Spanish"}, {"course_id": "3337914", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Content Marketing", "title": "Learn 4 STEPS to Make Money Online by Blogging!", "content_length": "173", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Roope Kiuttu", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "243", "students": "66150", "coupon_code": "C91E08AACDE8CDB0F18D", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3337914_127b_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/make-money-online-blogging/?couponCode=C91E08AACDE8CDB0F18D", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 14:26:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "867", "headline": "Learn SIMPLE Steps That Made Me a LIFE-CHANGING Income by Blogging!", "description": "<p><strong>Would you like to wake up in the morning, check your phone and see how much money you made while you've been sleeping?</strong></p><p>That's my morning routine.</p><p>Every single morning I&nbsp;like to check out from my phone how much money I&nbsp;have made last night.</p><p>But of course, things weren't always so good for me so let's go back in time back to 2015...</p><p><strong>How Did I&nbsp;Learn to Make Money Blogging?</strong></p><p>I was searching for ways to make money online...</p><p>Then I&nbsp;made a few searches on Google...</p><p>I&nbsp;saw a website where a man from the US showed me step-by-step how to make money blogging. </p><p>The process was very simple!

We plan on updating this course so that you can continue to use it as a reference even as QuickBooks Online evolves its software. We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online.

When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/1517986/preview/?startPreviewId=27837500", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2925610", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Sell Products with Facebook Ads Fast On Shopify 2022", "content_length": "82", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Yasir Ahmed, M.B.A", "rating": "3.4", "reviews": "72", "students": "29190", "coupon_code": "3082022", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2925610_f8b9_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/shopify-dropshipping-facebook-ads-ecommerce-masterclass-2020-2021-2022/?couponCode=3082022", "expired_date": "2022-10-05 19:54:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "683", "headline": "Built a brand Shopify store for eCommerce using secret Facebook marketing targeting strategy for ecom & dropshipping", "description": "<p>Learn how to <strong>create a Shopify dropshipping website for eCommerce along with a secret Facebook advertising strategy</strong> to bring in sales from anywhere in the world without any experience. </p><p>This course teaches you:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>Making Shopify Brand Store</p></li><li><p>Find Marketing Content Free For Ads</p></li><li><p>Running perfect Facebook ads to get sales </p></li><li><p>It requires no experience.</p></li></ul><p>This is a very practical course that covers all the basics you need to get started and start selling online in no time</p><p><strong>Don't waste your time and money on useless youtube videos that get you nowhere, enroll now and start selling today!</strong></p><p>regards, </p><p>Yasir Ahmed, MBA</p><p><br></p><p><strong>About ME:</strong></p><p>Use paid advertising to grow your business under my mentorship.

That means knowing the majority of AWS Certified Database - Specialty content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the AWS Certified Database - Specialty but it may take some extra work.</p><p><strong>Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day</strong></p><p>Remember that incredible things take time. And just like ancient monuments took years of effort, certification is not easy. It is not always quick either. But it is worth it! Our toolset allows you to engage with an incredible community of expert tech workers and add to the conversation. If you have questions, don\u2019t forget to leave a comment and reach out. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll get personalized help unheard of on test prep sites, without the outrageous fees.</p><p><strong>Always Check The Foundation</strong></p><p>Some certifications have requirements going back to older exams, while others use two or more tests to help someone pass. If you find the AWS Certified Database - Specialty is over your head, that\u2019s ok. It might make sense to see if a lower level exam will give you some clarity.</p><p><strong>If Offered, Read The Exam Objectives</strong></p><p>The exam objectives are different for every single exam and usually provided by the certification provider. These normally tell the test taker what subjects are relevant, what they need to know, and why the exam seeks to cover these topics. It\u2019s important to find them out for your specific exam. This can be found on nearly every vendor website and greatly informs the way you\u2019ll study! Don\u2019t worry though, we have taken those objectives into account and seek to create a testing experience comparable to an actual exam.</p><p><strong>Remember That Certification Is Quite Rewarding</strong></p><p>It can be hard to keep your focus on studying but remember that the best jobs in the world are only a few tests away. Whether you enter Cyber Security or do entry level tech work, certification is a clear, learnable, and rewarding path to careers that pay a LOT of money. They offer better work-life balance and you\u2019ll get in with some of the major leaders in the business world. So don\u2019t give up, it is worth it, and all this work will pay off!</p><p><br></p><p>This credential helps organizations identify and develop talent with critical skills for implementing cloud initiatives.

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4853996/preview/?startPreviewId", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4227290", "category": "Photography & Video", "sub_category": "Other Photography & Video", "title": "How To Edit A Feature Film By Yourself", "content_length": "160", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Hank Orion", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "63", "students": "22787", "coupon_code": "HANK-OCT", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4227290_a857_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-edit-a-feature-film-by-yourself/?couponCode=HANK-OCT", "expired_date": "2022-10-06 10:11:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "475", "headline": "A to Z Complete Editing Guide From RAW Footage To Final Master", "description": "<p>By independent director, producer and screenwriter Hank Orion.
