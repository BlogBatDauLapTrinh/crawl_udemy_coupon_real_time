It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself.

Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future media presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your media presentation skills right now.

With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. <br><br>React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.<br><br>Through a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.<br><br>In addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4789918/preview/?startPreviewId=43460982", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1913984", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Social Media Marketing", "title": "Secretos del Marketing Digital Org\u00e1nico en Redes Sociales.", "content_length": "412", "level": "Expert Level", "author": "Alvaro Chirou \u2022 1.200.000+ Enrollments Worldwide achirou", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "450", "students": "8719", "coupon_code": "FEBREROGRATIS2023", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1913984_4207_8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/marketing-digital-en-facebook-realiza-publicidad-gratuita/?couponCode=FEBREROGRATIS2023", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 11:20:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "564", "headline": "Haz crecer tu negocio o convi\u00e9rtete en un influencer.

Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies.</p><p><br>In Agile processes, there is constant feedback, allowing for team members to adjust to challenges as they arise, and stakeholders an opportunity to communicate consistently. Though originally created for software development, the Agile approach is now widely used in executing many different types of projects and in running organizations.</p><p><br>Agile grew from the minds of a group of software development project managers. Since then, it has continued to be popular in software development, but has expanded to many other industries as well.

The interview gives both of you the opportunity to exchange enough information to determine if you are a good \"fit\" for each other.</p><p><br>The <strong>biggest mistake in interviewing is not being fully prepared</strong>.

According to statistics, over 52% of the world's population utilises social media, equating to 3.2 billion users worldwide. Furthermore, the number of users continues to grow, with new individuals joining every day. These rising numbers demonstrate the marketing potential of social media networks. However, marketers face a difficult problem in utilising this potent technique. On social media, your brand must be consistent, accessible, and relevant. It's also critical to keep track of trends, evaluate the effectiveness of social media campaigns, and communicate with prospects on social media on a regular basis. It's challenging to do all of these things while operating many marketing initiatives. As a result, social media automation is an important part of marketing efforts.</p><p>Automation can help save yourself hundreds and hundreds of hours of manual work involved in curating and scheduling content for your social media posts to go live on your brand pages.

This can work wonders! </p><p>When it comes to measuring the results of your campaign, social media metrics are crucial. Compiling data should not prevent you from taking advantage of it. You must also make the best use of powerful analytics or reports function which we show you in the course so that you can gain valuable insights of what is happening across your social media channels. Social listening and sentiment analysis are two major and advanced social media automation jobs that allow brands to communicate with their prospects on a much deeper level too.</p><p>Enroll in the course now and let's start booming.&nbsp;There is no time to waste.</p><p>At the end of this course, Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan will discuss more tips on social media automation that will skyrocket your marketing to the next level of organic growth - whatsoever.

Digital Forensics Police", "description": "<p><strong><em>*Get the Official Certificate after Completing the Course</em></strong></p><p>Welcome to the 21st century, where almost everything is connected to a computer. Digital cameras<strong> </strong>are built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?</p><p>That activity is also monitored, and as a<strong> </strong>digital forensic investigator, you'll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.</p><p>Investigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator's attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.</p><p>Another important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don't even try to figure out what's wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201cdigital forensics\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201ccomputer forensics\u201d (also known as \u201ccyber forensics\u201d), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.</p><p>Computer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.</p><p>Computer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence. It is an applied science that is used in both civil and criminal investigations to provide answers to questions such as: what happened? how did it happen? who did it?</p><p>This section will explore the basics of Computer Forensics.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4594072/preview/?startPreviewId=40497018", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1543992", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Money Management Tools", "title": "QuickBooks Online Bank Reconciliation", "content_length": "346", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.1", "reviews": "58", "students": "7845", "coupon_code": "3425F82AF42EC87CD17A", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1543992_5a55.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-online-bank-reconciliation/?couponCode=3425F82AF42EC87CD17A", "expired_date": "2023-02-22 05:21:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "720", "headline": "Learn QuickBooks Online bank reconciliation process, how to enter the first bank reconciliation and read the bank rec.", "description": "<p><strong>If we are a business owner who would like more assurance about our books, a business professional who would like to advance our career\u00a0by learning the importance of bank reconciliations, or an accounting student who would like to see the critical internal control of bank reconciliations applies to real work software, this QuickBooks\u00a0course\u00a0is a course for us.\u00a0</strong></p><p><strong>Why choose this course?</strong></p><p>The bank reconciliation process is the second biggest internal control for most companies and one both large and small companies can, and\u00a0should, implement.

Some of its primary targets include reducing arms flows and combatting organized crime, as well as significantly reducing all forms of violence worldwide.</p><p>Today more than 600 million young people live in volatile and conflict-prone areas. Young people are disproportionately affected by the multiple and often interlinked forms of violence such as political violence, organized crime and terrorist attacks which exact human, social and economic costs. In the past decade, the recruitment of young people into violent and extremist groups has led some to view youth as a threat to global security and stability. However, research shows that the number of young people who actively participate in violence is a small minority, while the vast majority of youth are not prone to violence, despite the injustices, deprivations and abuse they can confront daily, particularly in conflict zones. Moreover, a growing body of evidence suggests that they can and do play active roles as agents of positive and constructive change, and the recently adopted Security Council Resolution 2250 on Youth, Peace and Security highlights this fact. It is a formal recognition of the positive role youth can play in the maintenance of international peace and security.</p><p>The maintenance of global peace and security is a cross cutting issue that is critical to achieving all the Sustainable Development Goals. Several UN offices are involved in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security including: the Security Council, General Assembly, Secretary-General, Departments of Peacekeeping Operations, Field Support and Political Affairs and the Peacebuilding Support Office.

The course starts right from the basics, where we explore various cloud computing service models. This includes infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. From there students gain hands-on experience with creating and administering remote virtual instances, complete with Ubuntu, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP. Students will learn the difference between popular web servers like Apache and NGINX, along with a detailed overview of various database management systems. This includes both SQL and NoSQL databases, in addition to database transaction standards such as ACID and CAP Theorem. In addition to a theoretical deep dive, the course demonstrates how to install, configure, and secure LAMP stack on Ubuntu for hosting dynamic, database driven web apps. We offer a detailed segment on server security, where students will configure both software and network firewalls for their instance using strict firewall policies, UFW and custom SSH ports. At this stage students will also learn to scale their servers both vertically and horizontally using application load balancers. <br><br>The second half of the course provides a comprehensive guide to Amazon Web Services. We start with demonstrating how to setup, secure, and navigate an AWS account. This includes setting up billing alerts and multi-factor authentication. From there, we take a deep dive into AWS Identity and Access management for enhanced account security, and the management of user accounts for various AWS services. Here we explore IAM User management and permissions, IAM Groups, IAM Policies, and access key rotation. Following the IAM section, we\u2019ll jump into the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service. In this module students lean to deploy virtual instances on AWS using Amazon Machine Images, Elastic IPs, and Launch Templates. We will also explore IAM roles for EC2, EC2 Security Groups, SSH key pair authentication, and remote administration using both terminal and EC2 Instance connect.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground and we hope you\u2019re just as excited about this course as we are, if so - hit that enroll button and let\u2019s get started.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4874958/preview/?startPreviewId=43791732", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "364026", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Other Marketing", "title": "Personal Branding: You Deliver a Great Elevator Pitch", "content_length": "599", "level": "All Levels", "author": "TJ Walker", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "102", "students": "18010", "coupon_code": "422E91CF87739431F66E", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/364026_36eb_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-deliver-an-elevator-pitch/?couponCode=422E91CF87739431F66E", "expired_date": "2023-02-25 12:14:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "766", "headline": "Personal Branding - You can communicate one good idea in less than 30 seconds", "description": "<p><strong>Personal Branding</strong>.&nbsp;Imagine delivering an elevator pitch to an executive who holds the future to your dreams, and the person says \"sounds interesting, please call my office and schedule a meeting.

It is a skill that requires physical habits. That is why you will be asked to take part in numerous exercises where you record yourself speaking on video, and then watching yourself.

You simply have to do it numerous times and work past the wobbling and falling off parts until you get it right.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tThis <strong>personal branding</strong>&nbsp;course contains numerous video lectures plus several bonus books for your training library.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tTJ Walker has been coaching and training people on their presentation skills for 30 years. Now, through the power of Udemy's online platform, he is able to give you the same high quality training that he gives in person to CEOs, Fortune 500 executives, and Presidents of countries. Only you can now receive the training at a tiny fraction of the normal fee for in-person training.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tHow long this course takes is up to you. The longest part of the course involves you speaking on video, critiquing yourself, and doing it over until you like it. But if you get to the point where you love how you look and sound when you present it will be well worth the time spent. And having this skill will save you time for all future presentations in your life.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp; \tYou can begin improving your presentation skills right now.

He makes every other course seem like a prologue and I know I am going to be the confident, well prepared speaker that I always sought to become. The magnitude of material and the pieces of golden wisdom are so practical to today's environment. It hardly seems possible that a teacher of this quality would be so giving and available to the average person like myself, when he is qualified to coach Kings and Dignitaries. Only one-third through the course and already my Charity fundraising efforts are more effective because I have gained skills to improve my communication, both my message and my delivery. The clarity of TJ Walker's delivery demonstrates his message in action. Follow him on Facebook and YouTube for greater depth if you find yourself improving from absorbing his work as I have. Do the assignments promptly and you will improve with each session. Worth the investment of time and that is what I value most, TJ WALKER delivered value with each session, and made the most of my time.\"&nbsp;Debbie Tudor<br></p><p>What others say about the instructor:<br></p><p>\u201cTJ Walker's single-minded devotion to presentation has made him the #1 expert for executives seeking guidance on speaking to the public and media.\" <em>Bob Bowdon, Anchor/Reporter, Bloomberg Television</em></p><p>\u201cTJ Walker is the leading media trainer in the world.\" <em>Stu Miller, Viacom News Producer</em></p><p>(TJ Walker's Media Training Worldwide) \u201cThe world's leading presentation and media training firm.\"<em>Gregg Jarrett, Fox News Channel Anchor</em></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/364026/preview/?startPreviewId=2290648", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4920268", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Tailwind CSS en 1h: Ma\u00eetriser ce puissant framework CSS", "content_length": "104", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Clara Donnart", "rating": "3.5", "reviews": "16", "students": "3538", "coupon_code": "4A2AA64C4707C3A67B9E", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4920268_a833.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tailwind-css-pour-les-debutants-maitriser-ce-puissant-framework-css/?couponCode=4A2AA64C4707C3A67B9E", "expired_date": "2023-02-24 16:45:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "747", "headline": "Cours complet sur Tailwind CSS pour d\u00e9velopper rapidement de superbes sites web", "description": "<p><strong>Vous en avez assez d'utiliser des outils de cr\u00e9ation de landing page professionnelle sans avoir \u00e0 tout styliser vous-m\u00eame ?</strong> Vous \u00eates au bon endroit ; ce cours sera un tutoriel complet sur Tailwind CSS.</p><p>Tailwind est un cadre de travail ax\u00e9 sur l'utilit\u00e9 qui transforme la conception de sites Web en un jeu d'enfant.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4741312/preview/?startPreviewId=42015852", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4607076", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Practice Tests: Agile, Scrum and using Kanban with Scrum", "content_length": "0", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Jimmy Mathew", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "1794", "coupon_code": "LETSSPRINTDOTCOM0223", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4607076_d40d.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-tests-agile-scrum-and-using-kanban-with-scrum/?couponCode=LETSSPRINTDOTCOM0223", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 04:57:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "213", "headline": "Questions from topics: Scrum Frame Work, Scrum Master Role, Scrum Product Owner and using Kanban practices in Scrum", "description": "<p><strong>Practice Tests: Agile, Scrum and using Kanban with Scrum</strong></p><p>Questions from topics: Scrum Frame Work, Scrum Master Role, Scrum Product Owner and using Kanban practices in Scrum</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Important notice: </strong>This practice tests are using selected questions from our practice tests, Scrum with Kanban Certification: 6 Practice Tests \u2013 2022, Scrum PO Certification: 6 Practice Tests, 480 Questions 2022 and Scrum Master Certification: 6 Prep Tests, 480 Questions 2022.

Political sociology deals with the relationship between state and society on the basis of mutual interaction and with power as the ultimate aim.</p><p>The course is provided both in the form of part-time as well as on correspondence basis. Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. Traditionally, there were four main areas of research.</p><p>1. The sociopolitical formation of the modern state</p><p>2. How social inequality between groups (class, race, gender) influences politics</p><p>3. How public opinion, ideologies, personalities, social movements, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics</p><p>4. Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media)</p><p>Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the founding fathers of sociology \u2013 Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber \u2013 to such contemporary theorists as Anthony Giddens, Jurgen Habermas and Michael Mann. </p><p>In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis, which overlaps with Marxist analysis. Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the \"power structure\" or \"instrumentalist\" approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3599646/preview/?startPreviewId=30093736", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "5056134", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "AWS Certified Developer \u2013 Associate Paper for Practice Exam", "content_length": "0", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Mudit Bansal", "rating": "0.0", "reviews": "0", "students": "576", "coupon_code": "534062180D005A78BBED", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/5056134_2ea8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-paper-for-practice-exam/?couponCode=534062180D005A78BBED", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 06:45:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "424", "headline": "AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice Exam recently released a new certification called the AWS Certification", "description": "<p>The <strong>AWS Certified Developer Associate Practice </strong>Exam recently released a new certification called the Amazon Web Service Certified Associate Program (AWS CAA).

We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. </p><p>After entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. </p><p>The course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>The course will then compare and contrast our different bookkeeping methods and show how those different bookkeeping decisions reconcile to the same numbers after the adjusting entry process. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 QuickBooks Backup files</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Excel practice files</p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Downloadable PDF Files\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The QuickBooks backup files are a great tool that allows us to jump ahead in the material or to rework material if we choose. </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>Who will we be learning from?\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who has technical experience in accounting concepts and in accounting software like QuickBooks, as well as experience teaching and putting together curriculum.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>You will be learning from somebody who is a:\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPA \u2013 Certified Public Accountant\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CGMA \u2013 Chartered Global Management Accountant\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Master of Science in Taxation\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CPS \u2013 Certifies Post-Secondary Instructor\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Curriculum Development Export\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>As a practicing CPA the instructor has worked with many technical accounting issues and helped work through them and discuss them with clients of all levels.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>As a CPA and professor, the instructor has taught many accounting classes and worked with many students in the fields of accounting, business, and business applications.\u00a0\u00a0 </p><p>The instructor also has a lot of experience designing courses and learning how students learn best and how to help students achieve their objectives.

It allows you to be happy just to be alive, even in the most difficult of circumstances; even when you're injured, or suffering a loss, stressed out at work, overwhelmed, depressed or anxious. It allows you to find the basic happiness of being alive, and that pervades everything else, so that you can deal with everything else much better.</p><p>Aside from just giving you that unshakeable happiness &amp; joie de vivre, it also gives you control over your mind in ways that are hard to even imagine before you experience it.

Isn't that weird?</p><p>To experienced meditators, this is not a surprise at all. It makes perfect sense that the world's most successful people are meditators. Meditation is a meta-skill; it's a skill that improves all of your other skills. It improves your ability to focus, so that you can do everything else better.&nbsp;In that way, meditation improves every aspect of your life, from relationships to health, happiness, productivity, career... everything.</p><p>In this course, you'll go from complete n00b to at least understanding the basics of meditation.

It has a close resemblance in ways of its capability with Microsoft's Visual Basic, Sun's Tcl, the UNIX-derived Perl, and IBM's REXX. As a whole, script languages are easier and faster to code unlike the more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. Though script languages take longer to process than compiled languages, they are very useful for shorter programs. JavaScript is lightweight and so is most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow the web pages to be\u00a0more user interactive.   </p><p>LiveScript as it was known earlier, JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0. The core of the language has been implanted in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers. JavaScript is designed majorly for creating network-centric applications. It balances and integrates with both Java and HTML. Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. This helps in making a web page not just a static HTML, but more user interactive. User-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates openly or implicitly can be done using JavaScript. Apart from its increased interactivity, it provides rich interfaces to webpages and can provide immediate response to the visitors.\u00a0 There is also lesser server interaction using JavaScript. JavaScript does not require any expensive tool to start working, a simple text editor like Notepad is enough.  </p><p>All these qualities make it a very important tool for someone who is interested in creating dynamic web pages.

Even if they haven\u2019t visited your website or browsed your app before, if they\u2019re opted into ad personalisation you can target them and convert browsers into buyers by matching the right products to the right people.</p><p>This method works so well, as by personalising the pitch you <em>massively</em> increase your chances of making a sale. You then can continue to retarget potential customers by sending personalised ad \u201creminders\u201d that encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads Can Be Used To Promote The Products And Services Of:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ecommerce websites</strong> \u2013 Match the preferences of your browsers and sell more</p></li><li><p><strong>Real estate brokers or listings</strong> \u2013 Target people looking to buy or sell property</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel companies</strong> \u2013 Match people\u2019s previous travel searches with your relevant ads</p></li><li><p><strong>Automotive brands</strong> \u2013 Sell your vehicles faster by laser focusing on interested buyers</p></li><li><p><em>And more!</em> Market anything using this highly targeted form of advertising!!</p></li></ul><p><strong>With My Course, You'll Unleash The Full Power Of Facebook Dynamic Ads So You Can Automatically Display Laser Targeted Products To Your Website Visitors Or App Users Who\u2019ve Previously Expressed An Interest In Your Business.</strong></p><p>You <em>do</em> need a basic grounding in Facebook Business and Facebook Ads before you study with me on this course, so if you don't have that, I'd recommend starting with one of my comprehensive Facebook Marketing courses for total beginners.</p><p>However, if you have the basics in place, and now want to master Facebook Dynamic Ads, this course will teach you everything you need to know.</p><p>To get started you\u2019ll need to set up Facebook Pixel on your website, which I\u2019ll guide you through. This is because Dynamic Ads work best when there is a strong feedback loop between your online product catalogue and your ads. Optionally, if you have an app, you can increase installs by showing relevant ads that direct people to download, and for this you\u2019ll need to install the Facebook SDK.</p><p>As Dynamic Ads work on a large scale, you\u2019ll require a Facebook Business Manager account and uploaded product catalogue. I will teach you how to correctly set up your Business Manager account <em>and</em> create and upload your product catalogue, so you can get started with Dynamic Ads right away. If you have a website powered by Shopify, Magento, or BigCommerce, you don\u2019t need to create a catalogue, so you can skip this step.</p><p>It's easy to learn using my method, as I've taken care to lay out everything clearly for you. Using step by step best practice guides, high quality video explainers, worksheets, and To Do Lists, you'll be able to expand your skillset and quickly build your Dynamic Ads knowledge.</p><p>Using real world case blueprints, and a wide variety of high performing Facebook traffic ad samples, covering a <em>multitude</em> of sectors, I\u2019ll lay out in-depth Every successful remarketing and retargeting strategy that\u2019s possible using Facebook Dynamic Ads.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be giving away my powerful in-depth guide to creating custom and lookalike audiences so you can get maximum mileage from your retargeting and remarketing efforts.

From there we explore the import dialog, import file handling, file renaming, and metadata presets. These are all instrumental building blocks when it comes to building proficiency in navigating the Lightroom workspace. Once we\u2019ve explored the foundations, we transition over to exploring the map module. Here we explore navigating the map module, with an overview of its use cases. From there we dive into geotagging both single photos and collection sets. Students also learn to filter images by location and use saved locations for enhanced sorting and tagging.<br><br>After completion of the map module, we transition to the book module. Here students will learn to create stunning, customized photo books using their image collections. We start with demonstrating how to navigate the book module interface. From there we explore book settings and layout options. This includes customized pages, page numbers, cell padding, and text formatting.

(with over 500 ratings)</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; COURSE REGULARLY UPDATED (Last updated: February 2023): NEW TIPS, MORE LESSONS &lt;&lt;</strong></p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; CERTIFIED COACH, SPEAKER, AND TRAINER &lt;&lt;</strong></p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; OVER 270,000 STUDENTS IN TOTAL &lt;&lt;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>How important is the need of negotiating? Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201cIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201d</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201cNo\u201d to the former and \u201cYes\u201d to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you about these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you uncover all these techniques in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of<strong> </strong>these activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. </p><p><br></p><p>But how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I've spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a <strong>7-step model \u201cN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System</strong>\u201d. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, and daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me. Within months, hundreds of people saved 1000s of dollars and made numerous connections with some very influential people. I believe it to be the most powerful idea for a business, career, and personal life. </p><p><br></p><p>But what makes it so special? Only my words? Or something else? Well, here is the answer. Drawing on the latest research and best practices across a breadth of industries, the course goes far beyond simplistic formulas such as \"win-win\" and \"win-lose.\" Instead, it provides hard-hitting, practical, intensive, and transformative techniques. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged and amused, and teach you life-changing skills for home and work. The course discusses lots of real-life examples (some of which will definitely get you laughing) and gives practical tools you can use right away to get better results. And what more and better than the fact that you can learn all this by just sitting at your home? You don\u2019t need to get mauled by scrupulous people before you can learn the art of negotiations. Although to master it, you need to walk out and experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>After attending this program, you won\u2019t remain the same; the impact will be severe. AND massive! Your life will change forever. This is the surefire mantra to big-ticket successes. You will learn the art of crafting such compelling messages that people will surely open their hearts and wallets for you.</p><p><br></p><p>All this can be a reality for you as well. Think big.

With online car repair training, you can become a skilled auto mechanic in just a few short months and kickstart your journey to a successful and fulfilling career !</strong></p><p><br>You are probably taking this course for one of two reasons. Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.</p><p><strong>Why Become an Electrical System Technician? </strong></p><p>In the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!</p><p>Today\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed. The future will provide great opportunities for those technicians who have prepared themselves properly and learn more with this Car Mechanic Course.</p><p>On the off chance that you're not especially precisely slanted, you might watch the people who are with appreciation, surprise, and irritation since they have something you don't: a comprehension of how things work and how things fit together. Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don't endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.</p><p>Fortunately, you don't need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle. I know; I've been there. The Introduction fills you in regarding my car revelation.</p><p>The Best Way to Learn Car Repair is start with this Auto Mechanic Course.</p><p>Obviously, the easiest errands can once in a while be the greatest obstacles to survive. All things considered, in the event that you couldn't actually sort out some way to open the hood, how might you check the oil or the coolant level? That is the reason I start this course with the essentials: straightforward positions that you'll have to do over and over \u2014 like opening the hood, lifting a vehicle, and replacing a tire. I likewise incorporate guidelines for filling the gas tank yourself (it's less expensive than full-administration), a reliable technique for dismantling anything and assembling it back once more, and security pointers that each technician \u2014 experienced and amateur \u2014 ought to notice.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4624160/preview/?startPreviewId=46881020", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2287899", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Taxes", "title": "Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) & Taxes", "content_length": "404", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "15", "students": "9157", "coupon_code": "67E7D484649997E665C1", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2287899_c80d.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/individual-retirement-accounts-iras-taxes-2018/?couponCode=67E7D484649997E665C1", "expired_date": "2023-02-25 04:48:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "679", "headline": "Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)-Traditional IRA & Roth IRA Income Tax Benefits & Retirement Planning", "description": "<p><strong>(IRAs) Individual Retirement Accounts, both traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs will discuss tax planning, concentrating on tax benefits of contributing to IRAs.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss the tax benefits of traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs), including how to record deductions related to traditional IRAs on tax forms, using actual tax forms as examples to demonstrate scenarios.</strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss contribution limits to traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and how those contribution limits interplay with other types of retirement accounts like employer-provided retirement plans.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss the tax benefits of Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or Roth IRAs.</strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss contribution limits to Roth individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or Roth IRAs and how those contribution limits interplay with other types of retirement accounts.</strong></p><p><strong>The course will compare and contrast Traditional IRAs and a Roth IRAs.</strong></p><p><strong>We will also cover retirement savings contributions credits, including qualification credits and examples of how to report the credit using actual tax forms.</strong></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2287899/preview/?startPreviewId=17296149", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2809111", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Wave Accounting", "content_length": "287", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "134", "students": "35230", "coupon_code": "25BD5671B0A28B60A124", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2809111_d44d_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/wave-accounting-2020/?couponCode=25BD5671B0A28B60A124", "expired_date": "2023-02-25 04:37:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "836", "headline": "Learn to use bank feeds with free accounting software (Wave) from a practicing Certified Public Accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p><strong>This course will use free accounting software which is an excellent tool to practice with.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will jump right into bank feeds and how to use them.</strong></p><p><strong>Many accounting software courses will spend a lot of time talking about how a full-service accounting system works.

Ready to get started on your journey to becoming a local search master?</p><p><strong>What Is Local SEO?</strong></p><p>Local SEO is the art of optimising the online visibility and discoverability of your business, to customers in your physical location. It also helps online potential customers to find out where your business is located, in real life. Local SEO has a lot in common with normal SEO, but includes the promotion of your location information, which you will need to optimise your strategy around.</p><p>When Google ranks websites for Local SEO, it examines normal SEO ranking factors AND a set of unique Local search factors. You need to score highly in BOTH, to do well in Local search.</p><p><strong>Google\u2019s Local Search Ranking Factors:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Where a person is searching from</p></li><li><p>The amount of Name Address Phone Number citations your business has</p></li><li><p>Whether you have a Google My Business listing</p></li><li><p>Your Google My Business Profile Keywords</p></li><li><p>How many positive or negative online reviews your business has</p></li><li><p>What keywords are used in your online reviews</p></li><li><p>How many \u201ccheck-ins\u201d your business has received (and how long people stay at your location)</p></li><li><p>How many times your local business has been shared on social media</p></li><li><p>Your brand\u2019s Google Maps star rating</p></li><li><p>Other behavioural factors like purchases</p></li></ul><p>There are also some other key things you will need to do if you want to be successful with Local SEO, that you wouldn\u2019t have to bother with if you had a purely online brand.

It is designed to maintain quality during production. Not complying with the good manufacturing practices can result in poor product quality and distrust the production in your organization. This course will cover the following sections:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Current Good Manufacturing Practices</strong></p><p>This section addresses Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a few different federal policies which have been promulgated for statutory effectuation and implementation withinside the main. The most important statute underlying such policies is the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FFDC) Act. This phase offers a particular hints and ideas which could function assessments for crucial operations in the complete employer just so powerful and incorporated great structures and product controls may be achieved. Each requirement this is loosely generalized in GMP policies may be enlarged and made greater precise as a way to encompass measures that the authors consider are essential for appropriate manipulate structures.</p><p><strong><br>Quality Management System and Risk Management</strong></p><p>This section will cover the two recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance Documents on Quality Systems Approaches: Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practice Regulations, September 2006, Final Guidance and Compliance Program Guidance Manual for FDA Staff: Drug Manufacturing Inspections Program 7356.002. These documents provide much insight into the FDA\u2019s current thinking and change in approach since the introduction of their Pharmaceutical Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs) for the 21st century initiative. To understand quality systems in practice also requires knowledge of fundamental work processes and process management. This chapter will explore the intent of the guidance documents and application to pharmaceutical quality systems and processes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Management Responsibility and Control</strong></p><p>Risk must be managed. There's no better approach than a purposeful management system that provides actionable data for your company to know where its day-to-day operations are at all times. This section provides a model for building a practical and effective management system to meet this expectation. I understand the rationale for FDA's requirement that administrators be responsible for oversight and control.</p><p><strong><br>Quality Control Unit</strong></p><p>In this section we will focus on the Quality Control Unit. The QCU is an essential support function for the manufacturing process and the responsibilities are broad. A QCU must have adequate laboratory facilities to effectively carry out its duties. It is interesting that this is being done in the realm of quality authorities and not in the realm of general laboratory testing. This can be interpreted as permitting the use of external contract laboratories where competence or expertise is required, but these must be fully evaluated according to procedures and approved prior to use.</p><p><strong><br>Finished Pharmaceuticals General Provisions</strong></p><p>The regulations in this section contain the minimum current good manufacturing practice for preparation of drug products for administration to humans or animals.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Production and Process Controls</strong></p><p>This section provides a clear overview on how to write procedures, calculate yield and identify equipment. You will learn how to test your materials and drug products, how to control microbiological contaminations and reprocessing. </p><p><strong><br>Records and Reports</strong></p><p>Here you will learn how to log and record all processes part of the GMP for Pharmaceuticals. You will be able to generate component, closure, batch/master production, lab and distribution records. You will master the development of use logs from equipment cleaning and the creation of complaint files. </p><p><strong><br>Clinical Trials Supplies</strong></p><p>Good manufacturing practice (GMP) stands for good documentation, good housekeeping, and good scientific practices, regardless of the end-user of a drug. Unique requirements for test methods create opportunities for innovative approaches to regulatory compliance. Additionally, because of the potential problems with visually similar containers and packaging with similar labels, creatively incorporate current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) principles and concepts into the clinical trial material (CTM) supply process. Adoption is just good business practice.</p><p><strong><br>Contracting and Outsourcing</strong></p><p>One thing that is common to the small virtual company&nbsp; and the multinational company marketing commercial product is that they both use contractors and outsource one or more operations. The section discusses different topics related to outsourcing manufacturing operations and can be adapted for individual processes that are outsourced to a contractor.</p><p><strong><br>Pharmaceutical Facilities</strong></p><p>Learn how to design and construct your pharmaceutical facility. We will cover all requirements for lighting ventilation, plumbing, washing, sanitation and more. You will be able to manage and maintain your facility and make sure it meets the FDA guidelines.</p><p><br><strong>Equipment</strong></p><p>We will look at the different types of equipment .

With networks, a single program can regain information stored in millions of computers positioned anywhere in the world. <strong>Java </strong>is the leading programming language composed from scratch with networking in mind. <strong>Java Networking </strong>is a notion of combining two or more computing devices together to share resources.</p><p>The first section of our udemy course introduces the essential network terminology and concepts. The networking support that Java provides is illustrated with brief examples. A simple client/server application is presented along with a threaded version of the server. We will also cover in our udemy course how nodes on a network use addresses. How <strong>Java </strong>represents these addresses is introduced along with support for<strong> IPv4 and IPv6.</strong></p><p>This section of our udemy course also covers how Java can configure various network properties. <strong>NIO Support</strong> for <strong>Networking</strong>, explains how the <strong>NIO package </strong>provides support for communication using buffers and channels. These techniques are illustrated with a <strong>client/server</strong> application. The support that <strong>NIO</strong> provides for</p><p>asynchronous communication is also demonstrated.</p><p>We will also cover in our udemy course how<strong> HTTP</strong> is an important and widely-used protocol. Java provides support for this protocol in a variety of ways.</p><p>These techniques are illustrated along with a demonstration of how cookies are handled in Java. We will also cover in our udemy course how<strong> peer-to-peer</strong> networks provide a flexible alternative to the traditional client/server architecture. The basic peer-to-peer concepts are introduced along with demonstrations of how Java supports this architecture. FreePastry is used to illustrate one open source peer-to-peer solution framework.</p><p>We will discuss about <strong>UDP</strong> and<strong> Multicasting</strong> and how it provides provides a less reliable but more efficient way for applications to communicate across the Internet. Java's extensive support for this protocol is demonstrated, including <strong>NIO</strong> support, and how UDP can support streaming media. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Scalability, I will explain how, as more demands are placed on a server,&nbsp; systems need to scale to address these demands. Several threading techniques supporting this need are demonstrated, including thread pools, futures, and the <strong>NIO'</strong>s selector. We will also cover in our udemy course Network Security, you\u2019ll learn how applications need to protect against a variety of threats. This is supported in Java using encryption and secure hashing techniques. Symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques are illustrated. In addition, the use of <strong>TLS/SSL</strong> is demonstrated. We will also cover in our udemy course covers how Java applications may need to exchange information with other applications that are written in different languages. The issues that impact an application's interoperability are examined, including byte order. Communication between different implementations is demonstrated using sockets and middleware.</p><p>All the Java program communications over the network are done at the application layer. The <strong>java . net </strong>package of the<strong> J2SE</strong> APIs comprises various classes and interfaces that execute the low-level communication features, enabling the user to formulate programs that focus on resolving the problem. The Java platform is highly regarded in part because of its suitability for writing programs that use and interact with the resources on the Internet and the World Wide Web(<strong>WWW</strong>). In fact, Java-compatible browsers use this ability of the Java platform to the extreme to transport and run applets over the Internet.</p><p>Java is a premier language for network programming.&nbsp; <strong>java . net</strong> package encapsulate large number of classes and interface that provides an easy-to use means to access network resources. Here are some important classes and interfaces of java . net package.</p><p><strong>Socket</strong> is the foundation of <strong>modern networking</strong>, a <strong>socket </strong>allows single computer to serve many different <strong>clients </strong>at once. <strong>Socket </strong>establishes connection through the use of port, which is a numbered socket on a particular machine. <strong>Socket communication takes place via a protocol</strong>. Socket provides a communication mechanism between two computers using <strong>TCP </strong>. There are two kinds of <strong>TCP </strong>sockets in <strong>Java</strong>. One is for <strong>server </strong>and the other is for <strong>client</strong>.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4381314/preview/?startPreviewId=46240008", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1868702", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Accounting-Statement of Cash Flows", "content_length": "572", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "261", "students": "41445", "coupon_code": "017D10F94F942194FE98", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1868702_a6d6_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/accounting-statement-of-cash-flows/?couponCode=017D10F94F942194FE98", "expired_date": "2023-02-22 05:11:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "735", "headline": "Use the direct method and indirect method to construct the financial statement explaining how to use accounting workeet", "description": "<p>Statement of cash flows creation and analysis. </p><p>We will introduce the statement of cash flows and discuss its purpose and uses.

Fortunately, this course is designed to be useful for both beginners and experts.</p><p>Our course starts at the basics, such as <strong>how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free</strong>, and then moves through an in-depth analysis of the software.</p><p>The course is designed so learners can go from start to finish but also have the option of jumping to the most relevant parts of the course, using the course as a reference guide to fall back on as needed, a dependable and up-to-date reference guide.</p><p><strong>We have updated this course each year and plan on continuing to do so as long as learners find it useful</strong>.</p><p>Courses on how to use software become outdated fast unless instructors are committed to updating the material, as we are. We also show lectures using the prior software versions, which will be relevant if you use an older version.</p><p><strong>This course will include backup files,</strong> a great tool to jump ahead or rework a portion of a problem. The backup files allow learners to have the exact same data as the example problem, so they can follow the presentation and perform the task in an easy, step-by-step process.</p><p>The first part of the course will demonstrate how to access the QuickBooks software, possibly for free, download it, and install it.</p><p>We will then use the sample file provided by QuickBooks to learn how to navigate the accounting software, locate the most commonly used areas, and understand the relationship between data input and the final product of financial statements and related reports.</p><p>The sample file is an excellent tool for learning how to navigate the software because it already has data in it, allowing us to deconstruct the process of data input by going to the end result of financial statements and drilling back to the source documents used to enter the data.</p><p>We will analyze transactions by accounting cycle: vendor cycle, customer cycle, and employee cycle. The vendor cycle may also be called the payment cycle, purchases cycle, account payable cycle, or expenses cycle. The customer cycle may also be called the revenue cycle, sales cycle, or accounts receivable cycle.</p><p>The course will break down the flow of data input forms in each cycle and the impact of each form on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>In the next major section of the course, we will start a new company file, an essential process for learning how to set up the foundational accounting system components like the chart of accounts, service items, revenue items, and beginning balances.</p><p>Learners will enter two months of data input along with instructional videos, entering a wide variety of common transactions and analyzing the impact of each on the financial statements and related reports.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, learners will prepare bank reconciliations using demonstration bank statements, learning how to perform a bank reconciliation, why we reconcile, and what outstanding items are.</p><p>The course also has an extensive section on how to use bank feeds. Learners will learn how to connect to the bank, download bank feeds into QuickBooks, and add the necessary data to include the bank data into the accounting system to create financial transactions or verify transactions that have already been created. We will also cover how to use bank rules to make data input much faster and more efficient. The course will demonstrate data input using bank feeds for checking, credit card, and PayPal accounts.</p><p>Next, we will enter adjusting entries; entries used to adjust financial statement reports more closely to their accounting basis as of the end of the month or year. Common accounting basis includes accrual basis, cash basis, or tax basis.</p><p>Learners will also understand how budgets fit into the accounting process, what some best practices are to construct a budget, how to enter a budget into QuickBooks, and how to run budget reports.</p><p>The course also has information on more specialized topics like using account numbers, customizing forms, using class tracking, memorizing transactions, fixed asset tracking, tax mapping, and multiple currencies.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/1412662/preview/?startPreviewId=45121674", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2675170", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Product Marketing", "title": "Product Launch Marketing Plan: GTM Product Management MBA", "content_length": "234", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Dekker Fraser, MBA", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "1425", "students": "22366", "coupon_code": "C56B4DB79D367056B1E4", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2675170_60b2_10.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/product-launch-how-to-go-to-market/?couponCode=C56B4DB79D367056B1E4", "expired_date": "2023-02-25 05:18:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "104", "headline": "Product Management Marketing Strategy, Product Marketing, Product Marketing Manager, Product Manager Marketing Plan", "description": "<p><strong>Create a breakthrough go-to-market product marketing plan in just a few days ... using this 7-step formula!</strong></p><p>\u201cGoing to market is just the process of convincing people that your new way is better than the status quo.\u201d</p><p>In 3,2,1\u2026product launch, Dekker Fraser and Spencer Grover offer marketing professionals and entrepreneurs proven and cutting-edge guidance for launching new products and getting ready to go-to-market, employing the latest marketing tactics emerging from Silicon Valley and the foundational thinking from top business schools. </p><p>In their 17 years of hand-on success launching tech products and organizing digital product launches for well-known companies like Sony,&nbsp;Salesforce, and the Google-backed Rocket Lawyer, the authors learned valuable real-time lessons that have been incorporated into their game-changing go-to-market <strong>marketing plan</strong>. </p><p>In this powerful <strong>product management </strong>launch blueprint and marketing plan, you will learn:</p><ul><li><p>The 7 key pillars of any successful go-to-market strategy, including target audience identification, developing value proposition models, building a product launch team, messaging and copywriting, demand generation, marketing mix and product pricing.</p></li><li><p>The 5 Cs of target market composition</p></li><li><p>Powerful tools for customer segmentation marketing and targeting</p></li><li><p>How to determine potential demand with market sizing</p></li><li><p>How to generate the maximum demand for your product launch</p></li><li><p>How to develop a comprehensive <strong>marketing plan</strong></p></li><li><p>Proven methods for determining your optimum product price</p></li><li><p>Common product launch problems and how to address them</p></li><li><p><strong>Marketing strategy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Product owner marketing plan</strong></p></li><li><p>GTM&nbsp;(go-to-market) plans</p></li><li><p>Startup marketing</p></li><li><p>Lead generation</p></li><li><p><strong>Business management</strong></p></li><li><p>Marketing management</p></li><li><p>Market plan</p></li><li><p><strong>MBA</strong> level product marketing management &amp; outbound <strong>product management</strong></p></li></ul><p>Do you want to get your new product in front of millions of buyers?

Student\u2019s questioning the relevance of what they are learning causes students to lose interest. A loss of student interest causes students grades to fall.</p><p>Part of the reason accounting textbooks have a difficult time incorporating the current topic into the big picture is that a textbook is restricted by what can fit on a page and the problems a textbook provides are restricted by what a student can accomplish with paper and pencil.<br></p><p>The use of instructional video providing a step by step process along with Excel that allows students to sum up large columns of numbers in a short time provides the tools to create a comprehensive problem that will demonstrate current topics in the context of the entire accounting process.</p><p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p><p>We will learn the accounting cycle in a comprehensive way and learn the fundamental of Excel.</p><p>Learning the accounting process without Excel or Excel without accounting is a waste of time and not an efficient way to learn either topic.</p><p>Like assets being equivalent to liabilities and equity, accounting is equivalent to Excel in many ways and therefore learning Excel will accelerate our learning of accounting and make what we learn more applicable.</p><p>Accounting is also the perfect tool to learn Excel. This course will not provide a broad overview of everything Excel can do because that is not a way to learn.

You have lots of mental energy (that's why you're so smart!) but you have a hard time directing it to one thing at a time. Many people go through their entire lives in this scatter-brained state, jumping from thing to thing, never fully concentrating on, or actually enjoying, anything. This can lead to major school &amp; career problems (not paying attention in class, not paying attention at work, not caring about what you're working on, bouncing from job to job, career to career, etc), and problems becoming a successful adult.</p><p>For some handicaps, there is simply no cure, no way out. Thankfully, ADD/ADHD is NOT&nbsp;one of those handicaps. ADD &amp;&nbsp;ADHD&nbsp;can actually be a blessing in disguise, if you learn how to channel your mental energy, to focus it, to make it like a laser. This is called <em>hyperfocusing</em>, and it is a superpower unique to ADD/ADHD people!</p><p>You may have noticed that while you sometimes can't focus on anything at all, sometimes you can get <em>extremely zoned in to one thing</em> (like these words, for example). And oftentimes (for some of us, more often than not), the thing that you're zoned into is the wrong thing. For example, my first year in college I&nbsp;got so sucked into social media that I barely went outside and met actual friends. Sometimes this still happens to me, if I pick up my phone right when I wake up and click on a social media notification before I&nbsp;start meditating for the day. Social media platforms are designed to suck you in -- that's how they make money. That's bad news for ADD / ADHD people. And there are tons of other useless, unproductive, time-wasting things that can suck in your attention, if you don't learn how to control your hyperfocus.</p><p>The good news is that you can learn how to control your hyperfocus, and use it to supercharge your life by focusing on the things you actually <em>want</em> to be focused on! It's not easy, but it is actually very simple. The answer can be written in just ten letters: MEDITATION.</p><p>Meditation is the single most important key to controlling your hyperfocus, focusing on what you want to focus on, and moving your attention to the things that you want it to be on. Meditation is not some woo-woo magical thing... it's literally just training your brain to focus. That's literally what meditation IS. It's a practice of bringing your mind into the present moment, and focusing it on one thing at a time. This practice strengthens the parts of your brain that are responsible for regulating your attention. Just like lifting weights builds muscles in your body, practicing meditation builds neural connections in your brain (it's a process called neuroplasticity -- look it up!). Just like your muscles get bigger from lifting weights, your brain gets bigger by practicing meditation! And just like you can focus your exercise on strengthening a particular part of your body (arms, legs, chest, etc), you can focus your meditation on strengthening a particular part of your mind (deep focus, broad focus, generating joy, love, happiness, etc).</p><p>Many of the world's most successful entrepreneurs, futurists, inventors, and celebrities are people who have learned to direct their ADHD energy and control their innate powers of hyperfocus. In this course, we will use meditation to do that, and more -- to become more focused, successful, stable, joyful, energized, and just plain happier in life!</p><p>By the end of this course, you will be experienced with five different meditation techniques, which you can practice in daily life:</p><p>- breathwork</p><p>- mindfulness</p><p>- mindfulness of breathing</p><p>- concentrating on a physical object, and</p><p>- concentrating on an activity,</p><p>You'll be equipped with the tools you need to become the best version of yourself, and transform your ADD/ADHD from a handicap into a superpower!</p><p>The skills you'll learn in this course will be worth 1000x more than the price of the course. Not only will this course save you money on ADD/ADHD drugs like Adderall &amp; Ritalin, and help you make tens, hundreds, or thousands of times more successful in life than you would have been without being able to control your superpowers of hyperfocus, the meditations you learn in this course will make you immeasurably happier, over the course of your lifetime. And that's kind of the point of this whole \"life\" thing anyway, isn't it? What's $50 in comparison to a lifetime of sustainable happiness?</p><p>Don't get distracted by any shiny things or other tabs. Click the button to sign up for this course now.

It depends on numerous factors.&nbsp;First, the objective of the content has to be defined and the audience persona has to be created. Second, the headline or the title of the article should be captivating. Then, the content written has to be unique and the Call-to-Action (CTA) has to be super-actionable.&nbsp;Once all the above attributes are taken care of, the content article has to be marketed in the right target niche' platforms for viral growth. </p><p>We should also not forget that the written content should appeal to the reader's emotions.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1.
