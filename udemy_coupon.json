Let me show you how...</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>I\u2019ll take the guesswork out of how to tackle the transition, by teaching you my proven 30-day return to work method: leaving you feeling calmer, more confident and in control - as well as freeing up plenty of time for you to enjoy your final weeks of maternity leave.</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>If you are spending the 3am baby feeds feeling anxious or overwhelmed about returning to work,</p></li><li><p>And you don\u2019t really know where to start with preparing your home, your family or your self for the transition,</p></li><li><p>And you wish someone would just hand you a proven plan of how to do this successfully, so you can go back enjoying this time with your baby\u2026</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>then this course was made for you! </em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>Having lived through the highs and lows of maternity leave, I remember all too well that feeling of time seeping away. There were months left. Then weeks. And then, finally, I was on the last few days. The burden of leaving my baby hung so heavy about my shoulders, tightened my throat and weighed on my heart. I was projected back to anxious feelings of early pregnancy as nerves - and nausea once again took its grip.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking down at your baby, you may not feel either of you are ready. Perhaps you don't feel really ready to leave your baby with strangers- or even with family. Perhaps you are worried about where you will find the energy to work full - or part - time... or how you will ever manage to get up in time for your commuter train if you have been up most of the night with your baby. Perhaps you are questioning how you will both survive on just a few hours together a day, when you are so used to uninterrupted days and nights together.</p><p><br></p><p>If you find any time to really consider your work, you may be contemplating how you'll manage to pick up your career where you left off - when you can hardly remember where you left the house keys. How will you go on to achieve anything at all in the workplace - in a career you once loved - especially when it felt like your brain has literally. Sound familiar? You are not alone!</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>So - what if...</em></strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p><em>you could spend more time in our final weeks of maternity leave focusing on enjoying time with your baby and less time worrying about the return to work?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>you had access to someone who had been through this all before as well as coaching coached other mothers, like yourself, in successfully returning to work - and who knows what you need to do - and can help you break everything down - into manageable daily tasks?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>you could stop feeling overwhelmed and didn\u2019t have to worry about working out what needs to be planned - and, instead could just take action?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>you were handed a ready prepared checklist of actions to take and in the order to take them - so you kick off the most important tasks first and have time for more fun and relaxation closer to your return date?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>you could understand each day\u2019s task in just a short, clear video - which you can still listen to even if you have your hands full with your baby?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>you knew the actions to take to make this a smooth transition at work, at home, for your baby and family - and for yourself?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>you could just spend your final day of maternity leave relaxing with your baby because everything is already under control and perfectly planned for your return to work?</em></p><p><br></p></li><li><p><em>You could walk into work on your first day back feeling calmer, more in control, more confident and more contented than do you now about the end of maternity leave?</em></p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Feeling calm, in control, confident and contented is within your grasp throughout this transition.

And how you transition into that life really matters!</p><p><br></p><p>In my case, as my return-to-work date loomed during my first maternity leave, I was surprised (and horrified) to discover how little practical guidance was available to help me prepare mentally, physically and logistically for this huge change.<br></p><p>I scoured the Internet for a countdown guide or checklist, but only found basic suggestions such as \u201c<strong>Be confident!\u201d.</strong></p><p>I felt exasperated:</p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>\u201cBut <strong>HOW?

I took advice from many brilliant women who had navigated the return before me.</p><p><br></p><p>A year later I found myself on maternity leave for a second time and - and to my my surprise I also had to file for divorce which meant my method went under some serious stress testing as I also adjusted to becoming a solo mother to two children under three and returning to a full time corporate career. As such I took the opportunity to turn my research and copious notes into an the comprehensive action plan that I wished I\u2019d had access to the first time around!</p><p><br></p><p>Now I want to share my methods and framework with other working mothers and help smooth your own transition back to work.</p><p><br></p><p>I am so excited to be joining you on this path and want you to walk into work on Day 1 feeling calmer, more confident and ready to rock it as a CareerMom.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The solution!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I am so excited to share my self paced course <em>Contented CareerMom: 30 day countdown plan for a calm and confident transition from maternity leave to working mother</em> with you!</p><p><br></p><p>I have personally designed this membership to help mothers like you to enjoy their maternity leave up to the last moment, whilst feeling more prepared and in control as they move to the next chapter.</p><p><br></p><p>My focus is to take out the guesswork, banish overwhelm &amp; help you take small steps each day to prepare you and your family for your return to work&nbsp; Step by Step - in just a few minutes a day.</p><p><br></p><p>You will get:</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Structured, daily planning</strong></p><p>A done-for-you 30 day countdown framework of the tasks you need to undertake to feel ready to transition back to work - covering changes at home, work, for your baby and, critically for yourself and your own CareerMom identity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Proven methods</strong></p><p>This course has been created by a mother who is a corporate management consultant, life coach and return-to-work mentor who has twenty years of experience in researching and solving complex problems for organisations around the world.

But, wait, automation technology might have a solution after all. <strong><em>Automation</em></strong> can definitely increase productivity, improve efficiency, reduce time and effort.&nbsp;In most cases, the automation tools learn themselves from the mistakes that occurred in the past and reduce the future chance of errors happening. </p><p>This mind-blowing course created by&nbsp;<strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" </strong>and <strong>\"First Look Digital Marketing Solutions\"</strong> is going to change the facet of technology to bring forth a revolution in the job-search and application process using the power of the LazyApply platform. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;You will save 100's of hours of time by automating the job-search/application process A-Z as you learn and master the automation procedure of applying to jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed.

            "description": "<p><strong>P</strong>ractice MCQ questions with answers to test your knowledge about Cloud Computing i.e. technologies, architecture, infrastructure, virtualization, data storage, etc. Test your knowledge and work on the questions you get wrong mostly.</p><p>From this course you will learn about cloud computing. you can see below for some about this:</p><p><strong>What is cloud computing?</strong></p><p>Cloud Computing: Simply put, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services\u2014including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence\u2014over the Internet (\u201cthe cloud\u201d) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently and scale as your business needs change.</p><p><strong>Types of cloud computing</strong></p><p>Not all clouds are the same and not one type of cloud computing is right for everyone. Several different models, types and services have evolved to help offer the right solution for your needs.</p><p>First, you need to determine the type of cloud deployment or cloud computing architecture, that your cloud services will be implemented on. There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud or hybrid cloud. Learn more about public, private and hybrid clouds.</p><p><strong>Public cloud</strong></p><p>Public clouds are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service providers, which deliver their computing resources like servers and storage over the Internet. Microsoft Azure is an example of a public cloud. With a public cloud, all hardware, software and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider. You access these services and manage your account using a web browser. Learn more about the public cloud.</p><p><strong>Private cloud</strong></p><p>A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organisation. A private cloud can be physically located on the company\u2019s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network. Learn more about the private cloud.</p><p><strong>Hybrid cloud</strong></p><p>Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options and helps optimise your existing infrastructure, security and compliance. Learn more about the hybrid cloud.</p><p><strong>Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless and SaaS</strong></p><p>Most cloud computing services fall into four broad categories: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), serverless and software as a service (SaaS). These are sometimes called the cloud computing stack because they build on top of one another. Knowing what they are and how they are different makes it easier to accomplish your business goals.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)</strong></p><p>The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure\u2014servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems\u2014from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.</p><p><strong>Learn more about IaaS</strong></p><p><strong>Platform as a service (PaaS)</strong></p><p>Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.</p><p><strong>Learn more about PaaS</strong></p><p><strong>Serverless computing</strong></p><p>Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing focuses on building app functionality without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.</p><p><strong>Learn more about serverless computing</strong></p><p><strong>Software as a service (SaaS)</strong></p><p>Software as a service is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet or PC.</p><p><strong>Learn more about SaaS</strong></p><p><strong>Browse a dictionary of common cloud computing terms</strong></p><p><strong>Uses of cloud computing</strong></p><p>You are probably using cloud computing right now, even if you don\u2019t realise it. If you use an online service to send email, edit documents, watch movies or TV, listen to music, play games or store pictures and other files, it is likely that cloud computing is making it all possible behind the scenes. The first cloud computing services are barely a decade old, but already a variety of organisations\u2014from tiny startups to global corporations, government agencies to non-profits\u2014are embracing the technology for all sorts of reasons.</p><p>Here are a few examples of what is possible today with cloud services from a cloud provider:</p><p><strong>Create cloud-native applications</strong></p><p>Quickly build, deploy and scale applications\u2014web, mobile and API. Take advantage of cloud-native technologies and approaches, such as containers, Kubernetes, microservices architecture, API-driven communication and DevOps.</p><p><br><strong>Store, back up and recover data</strong></p><p>Protect your data more cost-efficiently\u2014and at massive scale\u2014by transferring your data over the Internet to an offsite cloud storage system that is accessible from any location and any device.</p><p><strong>Stream audio and video</strong></p><p>Connect with your audience anywhere, anytime, on any device with high-definition video and audio with global distribution.</p><p><strong>Deliver software on demand</strong></p><p>Also known as software as a service (SaaS), on-demand software lets you offer the latest software versions and updates around to customers\u2014anytime they need, anywhere they are.</p><p><strong>Test and build applications</strong></p><p>Reduce application development cost and time by using cloud infrastructures that can easily be scaled up or down.</p><p><strong>Analyse data</strong></p><p>Unify your data across teams, divisions and locations in the cloud. Then use cloud services, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to uncover insights for more informed decisions.</p><p><strong>Embed intelligence</strong></p><p>Use intelligent models to help engage customers and provide valuable insights from the data captured.</p>",

If programming is automation, then machine learning is automating the process of automation.</p><p>Writing software is the bottleneck, we don\u2019t have enough good developers. Let the data do the work instead of people. Machine learning is the way to make programming scalable.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Traditional Programming</strong>: Data and program is run on the computer to produce the output.</p></li><li><p><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Data and output is run on the computer to create a program.

Examples include decision trees, sets of rules, instances, graphical models, neural networks, support vector machines, model ensembles and others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: the way to evaluate candidate programs (hypotheses). Examples include accuracy, prediction and recall, squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy k-L divergence and others.</p></li><li><p><strong>Optimization</strong>: the way candidate programs are generated known as the search process. For example combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, constrained optimization.</p></li></ul><p>All machine learning algorithms are combinations of these three components. A framework for understanding all algorithms.</p><p><strong>Types of Learning</strong></p><p>There are four types of machine learning:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Supervised learning</strong>: (also called inductive learning) Training data includes desired outputs. This is spam this is not, learning is supervised.</p></li><li><p><strong>Unsupervised learning</strong>: Training data does not include desired outputs. Example is clustering. It is hard to tell what is good learning and what is not.</p></li><li><p><strong>Semi-supervised learning</strong>: Training data includes a few desired outputs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: Rewards from a sequence of actions. AI types like it, it is the most ambitious type of learning.</p></li></ul><p>Supervised learning is the most mature, the most studied and the type of learning used by most machine learning algorithms. Learning with supervision is much easier than learning without supervision.</p><p>Inductive Learning is where we are given examples of a function in the form of data (<em>x</em>) and the output of the function (<em>f(x)</em>). The goal of inductive learning is to learn the function for new data (<em>x</em>).</p><ul><li><p><strong>Classification</strong>: when the function being learned is discrete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regression</strong>: when the function being learned is continuous.</p></li><li><p><strong>Probability Estimation</strong>: when the output of the function is a probability.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Machine Learning in Practice</strong></p><p>Machine learning algorithms are only a very small part of using machine learning in practice as a data analyst or data scientist. In practice, the process often looks like:</p><ol><li><p>Start Loop</p><ol><li><p><strong>Understand the domain, prior knowledge and goals</strong>. Talk to domain experts. Often the goals are very unclear. You often have more things to try then you can possibly implement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data integration, selection, cleaning and pre-processing</strong>. This is often the most time consuming part. It is important to have high quality data. The more data you have, the more it sucks because the data is dirty. Garbage in, garbage out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Learning models</strong>. The fun part. This part is very mature. The tools are general.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interpreting results</strong>. Sometimes it does not matter how the model works as long it delivers results. Other domains require that the model is understandable. You will be challenged by human experts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consolidating and deploying discovered knowledge</strong>. The majority of projects that are successful in the lab are not used in practice. It is very hard to get something used.</p></li></ol></li><li><p>End Loop</p></li></ol><p>It is not a one-short process, it is a cycle.

            "description": "<p>In today\u2019s work environment, there are many challenges, frustrations, and sometimes a lack of opportunity, turf wars, office politics, backbiting: you name it. But the question is, </p><p><strong><em>\u201cHow do you create your own success despite all of that is around you?\u201d</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>One simple solution: You need to get yourself another way of looking at all of this, create your own happiness, mojo, and drive every day.</p><p><br></p><p><em>In order to do this, you have to have an independent mindset first and then a lot more would follow.</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>About Me:</em></strong></p><p>I am <strong>Ash Seddeek</strong>, a speaker, bestselling author, and executive coach, and your instructor for this course.</p><p>My transformation to the independent mindset and success blueprint we talk about in this course is the result of working for others as well as for myself and picking up lessons along the way. You see I came to the US as a Fulbright scholar twice, so I admit I came with a lot of confidence and a desire to create a lot more success.</p><p><br></p><p>Over the past 25 years, I have worked for Fortune 500 companies which were the best environment to fail and succeed and learn from others along the way. These companies include Charles Schwab, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Oracle Corporation, Cisco Systems, BroadVision Corporation, Salesforce, and many others, and ran my 7-figure business providing services to high-tech firms. As an executive coach, I work with leaders on how they can become chief excitement officers, develop inspiring visions for their companies and teams, communicate with impact, and tap into the power of business storytelling to inspire audiences and drive successful business transformations.</p><p><br></p><p>In this course, I outline the success philosophy I stumbled upon as I saw the difference between working for Charles Schwab vs. Deloitte &amp; Touche. The vantage point of management consultant and client engagement mindsets changed the whole game for me and I hope my story and insights I share with you will be a game-changer for you, your daily success, happiness, and income levels.</p><p><br></p><p>Your success and financial independence are the strategic goals behind the principles and ideas in this course. Your massive success is what this is all about.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>In this course, you will</em></strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Identify the philosophy shift required for creating your own success every day</p></li><li><p>Discover the three mastery areas that combine the \u201cOwn it! Win it! Crush it!\" success blueprint</p></li><li><p>Learn the key mindsets and daily mantras required for success in each stage</p></li><li><p>Expand your self-driven daily motivation to create success for yourself and others</p></li><li><p>Create your own path for turning your current job or business conditions into more impact, success, income, and revenue</p></li><li><p>Embrace a new swagger in how you communicate, present, and get your work done</p></li><li><p>Create a strategic view on how everyday success is essential for the long-term financial independence you want to create for yourself and your loved ones.</p></li><li><p>Launch a new personal brand based on the \"Own it! Win it! Crush it!\" success blueprint and expect at least 30-40% more money in your pocket because as you increase the value of what you deliver at work or in your business, the more your income and revenue potential increases</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>I encourage you to tap into the activities, worksheets, tools, and action steps available for you in this course to put these powerful game-changer ideas into practice. Reach out to me as needed. When you become the master/mistress of your own universe, you are unstoppable! Here is to your amazing success ahead.</p><p><br></p>",

Sounds interesting?? Let\u2019s go ahead and learn what this is all about\u2026</strong><br></p><p>Let me ask you a few questions. Do children today use their imaginations as much as we did when we were kids? Do you see your children spinning incredible tales and stories in their fantasy play as we used to when we played \u201ccops and robbers\u201d or \u201chouse\u201d? Or does your child\u2019s fantasy play seem to consist only of repetitive movements which have no story to them? I am sure you are aware of such a situation\u2026 Nowadays children are no longer as creative as they once were.&nbsp; We live in an era obsessed with numbers, data, and test scores, especially as they apply to our kids and their education.&nbsp; Seeing the decline in creativity should make us concerned about our children\u2019s capacities to innovate, problem-solve, and navigate new and unfamiliar situations. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In the world of child development, you may hear the phrases like \u201ccritical thinking skills\u201d and \u201ccreative problem-solving abilities\u201d when referring to goals for your child\u2019s cognitive development. What we are really talking about is\u2026 imagination. The way to create human beings with imagination is to provide them with opportunities to develop it for themselves when they are very young. These opportunities are found in one place and one place only\u2026 that is, play. Played with paints, playing with play dough, costumes, glue, and crayons. Making a mess. Exploring the woods. Splashing in a puddle. Wondering at a caterpillar you notice inching by you. Pretending to be a bird, gliding through the sky. All of these involve a great deal of imagination and development of their creative skills to many folds.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as parents, we must first learn the process of creative learning which we can offer to our kids. We parents should make ourselves aware of the different aspects of creative learning and critical thinking skills so that we can create an environment for our children to flourish in that environment.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; In this course, we are going to discuss in detail the step-by-step process which you can walk your children through to make them creative learners and achievers. We have included many exercises and divided the course into 8 sections, each section focusing on the different aspects of creative learning for your child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this course, we will help you understand the child\u2019s psychology and you can help them in their creative journey. Being a parent I know the toughest thing is to have your child express their feeling to you. We have covered this most important aspect of creative self-expression through different exercises and fun methods.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Are you a Non Profit or Charity helping the world?</strong></p><p>Awesome! The world needs more people like you. Keep up the good work and let me know how I can help. To start with, get in touch with me to unlock free access to all of my courses.

What we generally do is let people brand us\u2026 That is we let them judge what we are rather than telling them who we are\u2026 This is because we ourselves are scared and not sure about how we must portray ourselves\u2026 So, what we do is let them judge who we are.</p><p>Positioning is not a statement about you \u2013 It\u2019s a statement that captures who you are, it\u2019s not a factual claim, but rather an emotional reason for people to want to be around you.</p><p>The positioning statement should be very crisp and powerful. The major problem with this is that half of the people might just start thinking about you in a variety of ways which might not be beneficial for your growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The world is an absolutely unfair place and positioning gives you an extremely unfair advantage</strong></p><p>Raise your hand, and say \u201cAye\u201d &nbsp;if you would like to have that unfair advantage.

            "description": "<p>The main focus of the discipline has been on the political processes which take place within human societies. Political sociology deals with the relationship between state and society on the basis of mutual interaction and with power as the ultimate aim.</p><p>The course is provided both in the form of part-time as well as on correspondence basis. Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. Traditionally, there were four main areas of research.</p><p>1. The sociopolitical formation of the modern state</p><p>2. How social inequality between groups (class, race, gender) influences politics</p><p>3. How public opinion, ideologies, personalities, social movements, and trends outside of the formal institutions of political power affect formal politics</p><p>4. Power relationships within and between social groups (e.g. families, workplaces, bureaucracy, media)</p><p>Political sociology is concerned with the sociological analysis of political phenomena ranging from the State and civil society to the family, investigating topics such as citizenship, social movements, and the sources of social power. The lineage of this discipline is typically traced from such thinkers as Montesquieu, Smith and Ferguson through the founding fathers of sociology \u2013 Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim and Max Weber \u2013 to such contemporary theorists as Anthony Giddens, Jurgen Habermas and Michael Mann. </p><p>In other words, political sociology was traditionally concerned with how social trends, dynamics, and structures of domination affect formal political processes, as well as exploring how various social forces work together to change political policies. From this perspective, we can identify three major theoretical frameworks: pluralism, elite or managerial theory, and class analysis, which overlaps with Marxist analysis. Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi-autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites. It can be split into two parts: one is the \"power structure\" or \"instrumentalist\" approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff.</p>",

Products look better than ever, interfaces feel intuitive, and companies are hiring designers at an increasing rate. But, the designer\u2019s role has been changing over the last few years. It\u2019s no longer enough to iterate and understand your user, instead in today\u2019s world, designers should be able to do both \u2013 identify problems and build solutions, which will increase their worth by at least 10 times for any company. When you can do both, you can do things that no one else can do and you will be a unique asset to your company.</p><p>There\u2019s a shift underway in large organizations, one that puts design much closer to the center of the enterprise. But the shift isn\u2019t about aesthetics. It\u2019s about applying the principles of design for a better user experience. This new approach is in large part a response to the increasing complexity of modern technology and modern business.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Most people don't think about how poorly designed everyday interactions are until they learn the principles of good design and user experience, many of which are not intuitive. You don't need to be born thinking about this stuff in order to become a successful designer, it's a skill that can be developed like anything else. Passion often follows knowledge and expertise.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p><p>In this course, I have explained the entire design process which when integrated into your product can create an amazing user experience. You will also learn to approach a problem in a systematic manner. Working in a series is the most important stage of the design process.

And for small businesses, the most succesfull ones, they are already doing it in a modern way from the first day.</p><p>This transformation - it is a moving away from old way of communications, like phone calls, email, or even fax - to new way - whatsapp, facebook messenger, instagram direct messages, telegram - any messaging apps that people are using in their everyday life.

To chat with an online store, with a bank, medical clinic - with any organization out there.</p><p>And here lies the opportunity!</p><p>All of these companies need employees or contractors who understand how to make this shift, this transition. New channels on the one hand bring a lot of new possibilities, such as chatbots and artificial intelligence, and on the other hand, require a rebuilding of current business workflows.</p><p>For example agent\u2019s KPI in a contact centre based on whatsapp, is very different from a voice-based CC.

How will I become creative?? Well! that is what YOU are going to learn in this course.
