business clients or small businesses who want a simple cash basis format for entering data.&nbsp; </strong></p><p><strong>This course is designed for bookkeepers and is also useful for small business owners who want a simple system for entering financial data into QuickBooks for financial planning and year-end tax preparation. </strong></p><p>The bookkeeping system we discuss will also describe the relationship between the bookkeeper, the business, and the year-end tax and financial statement preparers. </p><p>We will outline a cash basis bookkeeping system using QuickBooks, a system that will enter most transactions directly into the check register. </p><p>The course will discuss the responsibilities of a bookkeeper and the responsibilities of the business when a bookkeeping engagement in entered into.&nbsp; </p><p>We will work through a sample bookkeeping project in QuickBooks including the setting up of a new QuickBooks company file. </p><p>The course will practice entering data into the QuickBooks register directly from a bank statement. We will provide practice bank statements to use with the project as well as step by step instructional videos. </p><p>As we enter data directly into the check register from the bank statement, we will compare and contrast the cash basis system we are using to a full accounting cycle system. We will also review the financial statements periodically to see how QuickBooks is using the data to make reports. </p><p>After entering data into the QuickBooks check register from the bank statement, we will perform bank reconciliations. As we perform bank reconciliations, we will discuss what a bank reconciliation is and the benefits a bank reconciliation provides. </p><p>The course will then discuss options for entering specific accounting data into QuickBooks including payroll, equipment, loan payments, insurance, credit card payments, and invoices. We will provide practice QuickBooks files for different options related to the items listed above and explore the pros and cons of each option. The bookkeeping options will help tailor our system to our specific bookkeeping needs. </p><p>As we enter accounting data into the system we will discuss common questions we will have when entering the first few months of data and how to write down these questions, move forward with data input, and organize the financial data so that we can quickly go back to it once our client questions are answered. </p><p>This course will discuss, print, and export month end and year end reports, reports a bookkeeper may provide to clients monthly and reports the business will need at year-end for tax preparation. </p><p>We will discuss year-end adjusting entries. The bookkeeping system we propose will depend on an outside accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm to help with the year-end adjusting entries. As bookkeepers we want to be aware of the adjusting entry process so we can work with any year-end accounting firm, tax preparer, or CPA firm. We will enter common adjusting entries into an adjusting entry Excel worksheet and into Quickbooks. </p><p>Finally, we will discuss whether or not to enter the year-end adjusting entries into our QuickBooks bookkeeping system and different options to do so. </p><p>In addition to the instructional videos, this course will include downloadable&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excel practice files</p><p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Downloadable PDF Files&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Excel practice files will be preformatted and will generally have at least two tabs, one tab with the completed work and a second tab with a preformatted worksheet we can fill in as we watch the instructional videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p><p>Who will we be learning from?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2207674/preview/?startPreviewId=16596422", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2390114", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "PHP & MySQL - Certification Course for Beginners", "content_length": "196", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "3760", "students": "253150", "coupon_code": "YOUACCEL26223", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2390114_404d_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/php-mysql-certification-course-for-beginners/?couponCode=YOUACCEL26223", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 04:04:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "757", "headline": "Learn to Build Database Driven Web Applications using PHP & MySQL", "description": "<p>Welcome to the <strong>PHP &amp; MySQL Certification Course for Beginners</strong>.<br><br>This course offers a comprehensive guide to learning how to code in PHP.

"<p>If you had a passion for games growing up, you\u2019re likely no stranger to connect-4 - a wildly popular game with the objective of connecting four single colored disks into a grid-like holder before your opponent. With this course you have the opportunity to relive this fond childhood memory by building a connect-4 clone using React. <br><br>React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or Facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.<br><br>Through a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start with the tools needed to get started with React, along with instructions on creating the Connect-4 game board. From there we dive in to React OnClick Events, Passing Props, Destructing, React Children, and Passing Arguments. With a solid understanding of the foundations, students move on to various styling techniques for the game components, along with Dynamic classes, and handling callbacks. Here we\u2019ll explore inline, global, and dynamic styling coupled with dynamic classes. We will then move on to the React State Hook, React Key Property and initializing the game modules. Students then tackle more intermediate concepts including the logical components of calculating a winner, determining a draw, and React Lifecycle events. In the last module, we explore the implementation of AI for automated move suggestions, and single player games.<br><br>In addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, Booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4789918/preview/?startPreviewId=43460982", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1592366", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Financial Accounting \u2013 Inventory Costs", "content_length": "753", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.8", "reviews": "238", "students": "34278", "coupon_code": "01A9AC4787B245A718F2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1592366_e316_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/financial-accounting-inventory-costs/?couponCode=01A9AC4787B245A718F2", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 07:37:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "968", "headline": "Inventory cost flow assumptions - First In First Out (FIFO), Last In Firs Out (LIFO), Weighted Average Methods", "description": "<p><strong>We cover inventory costs and cost flows, including what is included in the cost of inventory and how to account for inventory freight costs, inventory insurance costs, and discount.

What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?</p><p>That activity is also monitored, and as a<strong> </strong>digital forensic investigator, you'll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.</p><p>Investigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator's attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.</p><p>Another important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty. They don't even try to figure out what's wrong with the tool by looking at the web or using the help system. To be a successful investigator, one must be persistent and creative \u2013 they must be problem solvers. Digital forensics is a branch of forensic science that collects, analyses, documents, and presents digital evidence related to computer crime for use in a court of law using scientific knowledge. Knowing what was done, when it was done, and who did it is the ultimate goal. The term \u201cdigital forensics\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201ccomputer forensics\u201d (also known as \u201ccyber forensics\u201d), but it has come to encompass all devices capable of storing digital data, including networking devices, mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, digital home appliances, and other digital storage media such as CD/DVD, USB drives, SD cards, external drives, and backup tapes.</p><p>Computer Forensics is a specialization that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence.</p><p>Computer Forensics is an applied science that deals with the recovery, examination and investigation of digital evidence. It is an applied science that is used in both civil and criminal investigations to provide answers to questions such as: what happened? how did it happen? who did it?</p><p>This section will explore the basics of Computer Forensics.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4594072/preview/?startPreviewId=40497018", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "965528", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Web Development Masterclass - Online Certification Course", "content_length": "1563", "level": "All Levels", "author": "YouAccel Training", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "8800", "students": "442985", "coupon_code": "YOUACCEL77359", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/965528_737d_7.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/web-development-masterclass-complete-certificate-course/?couponCode=YOUACCEL77359", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 03:58:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "700", "headline": "Cloud Computing | Web Apps | Linux | Web Servers | DBMS | LAMP Stack | HTML | CSS | JavaScript | PHP | + More", "description": "<p>This course offers a comprehensive look into the entire web development process - from local server configuration using WAMP and MAMP (Apache, MySQL, PHP)&nbsp;to production deployment using the latest web technologies including: LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, PHP and MySQL) for Ubuntu, HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, XML, and AJAX.</p><p>The content is ideal for those interested in working as a web developer, launching a web application,&nbsp;or devoted enthusiasts.

Although this seems daunting at first, it can actually be done fairly painlessly with some application. The key to forecasting sales is to understand the underlying assumptions and drivers of sales, then track and manage them.</p><p>A forecast can be described as an indication of what's likely to happen in a certain field in the future. In other words, a sales forecast tells you how much of a particular product is likely to sell in a specified market at a specified price in the future.</p><p>The ability to forecast sales accurately is key to a business' ability to produce the right amount at the right time. In addition, raw materials, equipment, and labor are all arranged in advance. The material is generally produced in advance in order to meet future demand, but some firms manufacture by order.</p><p>The process of estimating future work, like sales, includes estimating quantity, type, and quality. Having a thorough assessment of market trends is very critical for any manufacturing company. Future planning of the entire company depends on this forecast from the sales department.</p><p>What is sales management?</p><p>In sales management, you develop a sales force, coordinate sales operations, and implement sales techniques so you can hit sales targets consistently.</p><p>An effective sales management strategy is essential for any business. No matter what industry you're in, precision sales management processes are always the key to managing sales and boosting performance. Effective sales managers inspire and lead their teams.</p><p>Your sales management system can also help you stay in touch with your industry as it grows, which can make all the difference between surviving and flourishing.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Some of the most well known examples of organizations using React for their front-end include Netflix, Facebook, and Airbnb. Developed and maintained by Meta along with a community of independent developers, React remains free and open-source. React is a component based library built entirely on JavaScript, which makes it perfect for designing complex UI\u2019s. With React, developers can build encapsulated components that efficiently manage their own state and render UI updates specifically when data changes. For example, think of the automated content refresh feature you see on a twitter feed, or facebook like button. Here the state of the UI component changes on the page, without having to manually refresh when the data is updated. This is just one small, yet powerful feature of React.<br><br>Through a complete hands-on project, this course will teach you all the fundamental principles of React that you must know to become a proficient React developer. We start right from the basics, including the tools needed to get started. From there we dive into JSX, functional components, props, callbacks, and various OnClick events. By this stage, the calculator will have a complete visual display, coupled with functional arithmetic operations. Students then move on to passing parameters in Callback functions, using the React State Hook, and debugging.<br><br>In addition to the hands-on React module, we also offer a comprehensive overview of JavaScript for those who need a refresher. Here we start with introducing students to the document object model (DOM) which defines the logical structure of HTML documents. From there we dive into JavaScript to demonstrate various methods in which DOM elements can be manipulated to add interactivity to static components. We start right from the basics, which includes JavaScript placement, and data output. From there we move on to variable declaration, arithmetic operations, operator precedence, data types, and objects. Once the foundations are covered, we move on to more complex operations using Arrays, Conditional Statements, JavaScript comparison operators, booleans and loops. Here students will learn to unleash the true power of JavaScript to render different outcomes based on user interaction. We will explore the use of functions to efficiently handle repetitive tasks and JavaScript events to handle output based on actions and occurrences. The section will conclude with a hands-on project where students will implement their knowledge to build a web based photo gallery and background color changer.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4789922/preview/?startPreviewId=43477610", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4789952", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "Complete Bootstrap & React Bootcamp with Hands-On Projects", "content_length": "786", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "66", "students": "19712", "coupon_code": "YOUACCEL77359", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4789952_48df.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-bootstrap-react-bootcamp-with-hands-on-projects/?couponCode=YOUACCEL77359", "expired_date": "2023-02-26 03:58:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "569", "headline": "Learn to Build Responsive, Interactive Web Apps using Bootstrap and React.", "description": "<p>Welcome to the Complete Bootstrap and React Bootcamp. This course teaches students how to create modern, interactive web pages using the Bootstrap framework and React JavaScript library. The course starts with an introduction into Bootstrap with a focus on its reputation in the development community as the number one choice for mobile-first front-end web frameworks. Bootstrap is a well documented collection of reusable code written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We start with exploring the foundations of Bootstrap, including embedding it into projects, and building out the basic Bootstrap page structure. From there we catapult into the infamous Bootstrap grid system, along with the commonly used three column web page layout. After the introductory topics, students learn to work with a number of components from typography, tables and image styling right up to wells, alerts, and buttons. As part of the course we demonstrate how to build out intricate navigation menus using dropdown, collapse, accordion, and pill menus. We will also cover form styling, carousels, modals, scrollspy and just about every other Bootstrap component that\u2019s instrumental to your journey as a front-end developer. The module concludes with a hands-on project, where students will use a Bootstrap theme to build a stunning web page from scratch.<br><br>In the second section of the course, we explore React. React, also known as React JS, is a powerful JavaScript library used for building custom, interactive user interfaces using UI components. Similar to Bootstrap, React is a well documented free and open source library. The project was founded by Meta and a network of independent developers. In this section, students learn how to use the React library through a series of hands-on projects. The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator. From there we will dive into project number two, where you will build a connect-4 clone. Here we will cover more intermediate concepts including passing props, destructuring, passing arguments to click events, various styling methods, and handling callbacks. You will also learn about the React key property, React lifecycle events, and conditional rendering. By the end you will have built a complete multi and single player connect-4 game board with built-in AI capabilities. <br><br>In the final section of the course we further unleash the power of React by building out a complete e-commerce site with multiple product categories, a product showcase, shopping cart feature, and much more. Here, we introduce a number of integral new concepts including: JSON server, Fetch API, and installing React router. These essential building blocks will be used to render the product categories, style the product list, and configure the product details page. From there we dive into styled components, refactoring the shop layout, and exploring the concept of \u201ccontext\u201d in React. In the final stages of the project students will configure the shopping cart basket, and the checkout feature. We will also implement a product search feature, followed by in-depth exercises on validating input forms in React.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a tremendous bit of ground.

As a matter of fact, React was developed by Meta alongside a community of independent developers. Until this day, React remains free and open-source so it has plenty of support and documentation. Unlike jQuery which interacts with the document object model directly, React works through a \u201cvirtual\u201d DOM. React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React and determines updates based on its own internal representations. React is best for creating reusable code blocks for UI components and layering them on top of each other to minimize the number of times the DOM needs to be re-rendering on state changes. <br><br>The React section of this course starts off with a hands-on project where you\u2019ll learn how to work with functional React components, props, Callback functions, OnClick Events, and the React State hook to build a fully functional calculator.

Does it impact your life and your money? Well, all that I would say is, \u201cIf you can\u2019t negotiate effectively with people, you shouldn\u2019t buy/sell anything for more than a few dollars.\u201d</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The reason I say this is because regardless of the type of work we do, knowing how to negotiate effectively can greatly impact our success and our satisfaction. Wondering how? I will tell you how\u2026 but before that let me remind you how often you negotiate in life. From childhood, you must have practiced the art of negotiation \u2013 Bedtime, a treat, a promotion, a raise, an extended deadline. Yet you are not good at negotiations. Why? Does it demand a different level of intellect and expertise? Well, I will say \u201cNo\u201d to the former and \u201cYes\u201d to the latter. There are some techniques and a process when put into practice enable you to save thousands of dollars, but unfortunately, no one has told you about these techniques yet, and hence, you are missing out. And by this time, I am sure you must have figured out what I am doing here. I am here to help you uncover all these techniques in this course.</p><p><br></p><p>It may be\u2026or may not be difficult for you to digest the fact that we all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers, and employers, among others. We come across hundreds of situations that put our negotiation skills to the test. Whether buying a house or car, reviewing your salary with your boss, or deliberating contracts for your business, your success in each of<strong> </strong>these activities will be heavily dependent on your ability to negotiate. </p><p><br></p><p>But how come I am speaking so highly of negotiation skills? Well, I've spent thousands of hours reading books, articles, and videos and doing real-life research aiming to master negotiation conversations. And now, I want my learnings to benefit you so that you don\u2019t need to chart the long road which I have trodden. I want my long road to be your shortcut and hence, I have created a <strong>7-step model \u201cN.E.U.R.O Negotiation System</strong>\u201d. Combining the principles of Evolution and Brain Science, this program demystifies the science of negotiation like nothing else. This course will help you prepare for and conduct real-world negotiations, from personal to professional, small to large, and daily to extraordinary. You won\u2019t be able to find anything else even one-hundredth as valuable and jaw-dropping. If you get it, please feel free to revert to me. Within months, hundreds of people saved 1000s of dollars and made numerous connections with some very influential people. I believe it to be the most powerful idea for a business, career, and personal life. </p><p><br></p><p>But what makes it so special? Only my words? Or something else? Well, here is the answer. Drawing on the latest research and best practices across a breadth of industries, the course goes far beyond simplistic formulas such as \"win-win\" and \"win-lose.\" Instead, it provides hard-hitting, practical, intensive, and transformative techniques. This course is guaranteed to keep you engaged and amused, and teach you life-changing skills for home and work.

And what more and better than the fact that you can learn all this by just sitting at your home? You don\u2019t need to get mauled by scrupulous people before you can learn the art of negotiations. Although to master it, you need to walk out and experiment.</p><p><br></p><p>After attending this program, you won\u2019t remain the same; the impact will be severe. AND massive! Your life will change forever. This is the surefire mantra to big-ticket successes.

Either you are preparing yourself to enter into the field of automotive service, or you are expanding your skills to include automotive electrical systems. In either case, congratulations on selecting one of the most fast-paced segments of the automotive industry. Working with the electrical systems can be challenging, yet very rewarding; however, it can also be very frustrating at times. For many people, learning electrical systems can be a struggle. It is my hope that I am able to present the course to you in such a manner that you will not only understand electrical systems, but will excel at it. There are many ways the theory of electricity can be explained, and many metaphors can be used. Some compare electricity to a water flow, while others explain it in a purely scientific fashion. Everyone learns differently. I am presenting electrical theory in a manner that I hope will be clear and concise. If you do not fully comprehend a concept, then it is important to discuss it with your instructor. Electricity is somewhat abstract; so if you do have questions, be sure to ask me in Udemy ask section.</p><p><strong>Why Become an Electrical System Technician? </strong></p><p>In the past, it was possible for technicians to work their entire careers and be able to almost completely avoid the vehicle\u2019s electrical systems. They would specialize in engines, steering/ suspension, or brakes. Today, there is not a system on the vehicle that is immune to the role of electrical circuits. Engine controls, electronic suspension systems, and anti-lock brakes are common on today\u2019s vehicles. Even electrical systems that were once thought of as being simple have evolved to computer controls. Headlights are now pulse-width modulated using high side drivers and will automatically brighten and dim based on the light intensity of oncoming traffic. Today\u2019s vehicles are equipped with twenty or more computers, laser-guided cruise control, sonar park assist, infrared climate control, fiber optics, and radio frequency transponders and decoders. Simple systems have become more computers reliant. For example, the horn circuit on the 2008 Chrysler 300C involves three separate control modules to function. Even the tires have computers involved, with the addition of tire pressure monitoring systems!</p><p>Today\u2019s technician must possess a full and complete electrical background to be able to succeed. The future will provide great opportunities for those technicians who have prepared themselves properly and learn more with this Car Mechanic Course.</p><p>On the off chance that you're not especially precisely slanted, you might watch the people who are with appreciation, surprise, and irritation since they have something you don't: a comprehension of how things work and how things fit together. Whenever they dismantle something, they can reassemble it how it was. Whenever they say that they need to investigate the hood, they can really get the darn thing open. Furthermore, when they need to change a level, they don't endure ten minutes attempting to sort out which end of the raise is.</p><p>Fortunately, you don't need to be brought into the world with a wrench in your grasp to know how to fix things \u2014 even things as apparently convoluted as a vehicle. I know; I've been there. The Introduction fills you in regarding my car revelation.</p><p>The Best Way to Learn Car Repair is start with this Auto Mechanic Course.</p><p>Obviously, the easiest errands can once in a while be the greatest obstacles to survive. All things considered, in the event that you couldn't actually sort out some way to open the hood, how might you check the oil or the coolant level? That is the reason I start this course with the essentials: straightforward positions that you'll have to do over and over \u2014 like opening the hood, lifting a vehicle, and replacing a tire. I likewise incorporate guidelines for filling the gas tank yourself (it's less expensive than full-administration), a reliable technique for dismantling anything and assembling it back once more, and security pointers that each technician \u2014 experienced and amateur \u2014 ought to notice.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4624160/preview/?startPreviewId=46881020", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2907194", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Business Law", "title": "Understanding HIPAA Compliance", "content_length": "52", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Learnsector LLP", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "408", "students": "37237", "coupon_code": "65168DDB2B063E75B866", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2907194_e2a6.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-hipaa-compliance/?couponCode=65168DDB2B063E75B866", "expired_date": "2023-02-25 12:31:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "915", "headline": "This course helps you understand the various rules under HIPAA and how to be compliant with that.", "description": "<p>This course gives you a basic understanding of the US regulation, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 or HIPPA as it is commonly known.

It has a close resemblance in ways of its capability with Microsoft's Visual Basic, Sun's Tcl, the UNIX-derived Perl, and IBM's REXX. As a whole, script languages are easier and faster to code unlike the more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++. Though script languages take longer to process than compiled languages, they are very useful for shorter programs. JavaScript is lightweight and so is most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow the web pages to be\u00a0more user interactive.   </p><p>LiveScript as it was known earlier, JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0. The core of the language has been implanted in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers. JavaScript is designed majorly for creating network-centric applications. It balances and integrates with both Java and HTML. Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. This helps in making a web page not just a static HTML, but more user interactive. User-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates openly or implicitly can be done using JavaScript.

Even if they haven\u2019t visited your website or browsed your app before, if they\u2019re opted into ad personalisation you can target them and convert browsers into buyers by matching the right products to the right people.</p><p>This method works so well, as by personalising the pitch you <em>massively</em> increase your chances of making a sale. You then can continue to retarget potential customers by sending personalised ad \u201creminders\u201d that encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads Can Be Used To Promote The Products And Services Of:</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Ecommerce websites</strong> \u2013 Match the preferences of your browsers and sell more</p></li><li><p><strong>Real estate brokers or listings</strong> \u2013 Target people looking to buy or sell property</p></li><li><p><strong>Travel companies</strong> \u2013 Match people\u2019s previous travel searches with your relevant ads</p></li><li><p><strong>Automotive brands</strong> \u2013 Sell your vehicles faster by laser focusing on interested buyers</p></li><li><p><em>And more!</em> Market anything using this highly targeted form of advertising!!</p></li></ul><p><strong>With My Course, You'll Unleash The Full Power Of Facebook Dynamic Ads So You Can Automatically Display Laser Targeted Products To Your Website Visitors Or App Users Who\u2019ve Previously Expressed An Interest In Your Business.</strong></p><p>You <em>do</em> need a basic grounding in Facebook Business and Facebook Ads before you study with me on this course, so if you don't have that, I'd recommend starting with one of my comprehensive Facebook Marketing courses for total beginners.</p><p>However, if you have the basics in place, and now want to master Facebook Dynamic Ads, this course will teach you everything you need to know.</p><p>To get started you\u2019ll need to set up Facebook Pixel on your website, which I\u2019ll guide you through. This is because Dynamic Ads work best when there is a strong feedback loop between your online product catalogue and your ads. Optionally, if you have an app, you can increase installs by showing relevant ads that direct people to download, and for this you\u2019ll need to install the Facebook SDK.</p><p>As Dynamic Ads work on a large scale, you\u2019ll require a Facebook Business Manager account and uploaded product catalogue. I will teach you how to correctly set up your Business Manager account <em>and</em> create and upload your product catalogue, so you can get started with Dynamic Ads right away. If you have a website powered by Shopify, Magento, or BigCommerce, you don\u2019t need to create a catalogue, so you can skip this step.</p><p>It's easy to learn using my method, as I've taken care to lay out everything clearly for you. Using step by step best practice guides, high quality video explainers, worksheets, and To Do Lists, you'll be able to expand your skillset and quickly build your Dynamic Ads knowledge.</p><p>Using real world case blueprints, and a wide variety of high performing Facebook traffic ad samples, covering a <em>multitude</em> of sectors, I\u2019ll lay out in-depth Every successful remarketing and retargeting strategy that\u2019s possible using Facebook Dynamic Ads.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be giving away my powerful in-depth guide to creating custom and lookalike audiences so you can get maximum mileage from your retargeting and remarketing efforts.
