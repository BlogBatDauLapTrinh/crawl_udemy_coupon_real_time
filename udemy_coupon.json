amazing techniques and tools that will help you to create effective YouTube Advertising Campaigns in 2022", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience</em><strong> \"The Ultimate YouTube Advertising Course for Beginners\" in 2022</strong> created by <strong><em>Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\".</em></strong></p><p>As digital marketing expands and evolves, the tools we use to advertise ourselves must also develop. Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you. What's more?&nbsp;This course will also contain the Google Ads dashboard walkthrough taught by Srinidhi and video advertising campaign creation steps along with the report-seeking process.</p><p>It's time to become a Professional YouTube Advertising Expert in the fastest time possible ever!</p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p><p>Enroll now and let's start the magic.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4549894/preview/?startPreviewId=39456050", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4165158", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "Tekla Structures shop drawing R.C.C Building", "content_length": "199", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Ahmad Traboulsi", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "96", "students": "10030", "coupon_code": "30B6CFB7CB42F2831CA4", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4165158_7eb3_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/tekla-structures-shop-drawing-rcc-building/?couponCode=30B6CFB7CB42F2831CA4", "expired_date": "2022-09-09 16:27:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "135", "headline": "Shop drawing and modeling R.C.C building in TEKLA", "description": "<p>Tekla structures is a building information modeling software able to model structures that incorporate different kinds of building materials, including steel, concrete, timber, and glass.</p><p>Tekla structures the most advanced structural BIM&nbsp;software, lets you create, combine, manage and share multi-material 3D&nbsp;models packed with valuable construction information. </p><p>With Tekla structures you can create accurate information-rich 3D models that have all the structural data you need to build and maintain any type of structure. </p><p>You can also import, export and link your data with other software solutions, digital construction tools and fabrication machinery for smoother workflow.</p><p>In this course we will learn the <strong>shop drawing </strong>and <strong>modeling</strong> of a r<strong>einforcement concrete building consists of 4 stories.</strong> </p><p>We will learn how we can generate the shop drawings of all the structural elements (<strong>foundation layout, columns layout, beams layout, slab layout</strong>)</p><p>We will learn how we can do <strong>sections using Tekla</strong> to get more <strong>details drawings in beams or columns or foundations.</strong></p><p>We will learn how to generate the<strong> Bill of Quantity table in Tekla structure</strong></p><p> The dimensions and properties for structural sections commonly used in R.C.C building structure design and construction are given in this course in addition to all design consideration and&nbsp; proper material availability and specification according the <strong>ACI code.</strong></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4165158/preview/?startPreviewId=34822646", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4709446", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Management", "title": "The Complete ISO 31000 Master Class, Safeguard the Business!", "content_length": "190", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Sameh Elsayed", "rating": "3.3", "reviews": "9", "students": "1963", "coupon_code": "SAMEH_ELSAYED_2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4709446_ab1f.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-iso-31000-masterclass/?couponCode=SAMEH_ELSAYED_2", "expired_date": "2022-09-11 06:06:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "249", "headline": "Your Comprehensive guide to be an Enterprise Risk Management Expert who makes a difference.", "description": "<p>Risk is present in every aspect of our life.

tools", "description": "<p>Personal Capital is currently a free software that can connect to financial institutions, pulling in financial asset and liability balances, as well as transaction detail, into one location.</p><p>The strong areas of benefit of using Personal Capital software are its ability to provide net worth or balance sheet information, investment management information, and planning tools such as retirement planning and other large planning goals.</p><p>The Personal Capital software also downloads transaction detail and allows for the categorization or assigning of accounts and tags that can then be used to generate an income statement. It also has budgeting tools to help with shorter-term cash flow management.</p><p>This course will discuss how to set up the Personal Capital software and link to accounts. We will also discuss some reasons why the software may be offered for free and look over Personal Capital data security.</p><p>We will compare the Personal Capital software to other types of software that can connect directly to financial institutions and pull financial information, such software generally falling into the category of accounting software that uses the double-entry accounting system or financial management software.</p><p>Accounting software using the double-entry accounting system includes packages such as QuickBooks, Xero, &amp; Wave accounting. Although accounting software utilizes financial institution connectivity it generally does so differently than Personal Capital software, which falls into the financial management category. We will discuss the differences in software.</p><p>Other financial management and budgeting software include Quicken, Mint, and Microsoft Excel, Excel actually having a template called Money in Excel that has financial institution connectivity.</p><p>Learners will practice converting financial data into an income statement by downloading transactions from financial institutions, categorizing them, and then exporting them into Excel for sorting. We will compare the process with what would be done using accounting software like QuickBooks.</p><p>The course will discuss the benefits of the personal net worth or balance sheet functionality of Personal Capital software, the software pulling in assets and liability balances automatically for items such as bank accounts, investment accounts like 401(K), savings accounts, CD accounts, credit card balances, mortgage balances, and loan balances.</p><p>We will also discuss the benefit of the software providing more detail on our investment holdings and providing insights and suggestions to improve returns and reduce risk. The ability to pull investments into one place allows a more rounded analysis of the data than you may get from one brokerage account analyzed in isolation.</p><p>Learners will be able to use the projection planner to help plan for retirement and other large investment items. The Personal Capital software utilizes sophisticated analytical tools including a Monte Carlo Simulation tool.</p><p>We will also explore the home appraisal tool offered by the software and we will practice adding non-financial institution assets and liabilities, making our net worth or balance sheet completer and more accurate.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3916670/preview/?startPreviewId=32191474", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2570584", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Mobile Development", "title": "The Android-Kotlin Development Guide", "content_length": "592", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Hassan Fulaih", "rating": "4.6", "reviews": "298", "students": "42548", "coupon_code": "SE1-2022", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2570584_7a45.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/nfifedvr/?couponCode=SE1-2022", "expired_date": "2022-09-08 13:53:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "6", "headline": "\u062a\u0639\u0644\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0623\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u062a\u0644\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641\u0631", "description": "<p> \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u064a\u062f \u0628\u0623\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0627\u0645 \u0643\u0648\u062a\u0644\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u062b \u0627\u0641\u062a\u0631\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0627\u0645\u0627\u0645\u064a \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u064a \u0634\u064a \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u064a\u062f \u0633\u062a\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0648</p><p> \u0633\u062a\u062a\u0645\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0649 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u062a\u0637\u0648\u064a\u0631 \u062a\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0648\u064a\u062f </p><p>\u062a\u062a\u0645\u064a\u0632 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0623\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0644\u064a\u0633 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u062a\u0634\u0639\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0648\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0644 \u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a\u0629</p><p><br></p><p>\u0644\u0642\u062f \u063a\u0637\u064a\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0627\u0636\u064a\u0639 \u0645\u062b\u0644</p><p>Layouts</p><p>Res Files</p><p>Toast</p><p>View</p><p>SetOnClickListener</p><p>Intent</p><p>WebView</p><p>Ic Icon Luncher</p><p>APK</p><p>PutExtra</p><p>IntentFilter</p><p>Get Data From Activity</p><p>TextWacher</p><p>Animation</p><p>List View</p><p>Custom ListView</p><p>Recycler View</p><p>Grid View</p><p>Spinner</p><p>LayoutInflater</p><p>AlertDialog</p><p>Fragments</p><p>Scrollable Tabs</p><p>((Material Design))</p><p>Data Storage</p><p>Location</p><p>((Firebase))</p><p>\u0648\u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Should you learn Kotlin?</em></strong></p><p>Now that Google are pushing so hard for Android developers to use Kotlin, we are seeing a dramatic shift to Kotlin - It's similar to the iOS situation a few years ago with Objective-C when Apple released Swift.</p><p>Fast forward a few years and everyone is using Swift.

Whether it makes goods cheaper for the common man like you and me, nobody can tell. But this is going to impact our lives in our jobs, our businesses, and the overall economic environment. Reason enough for us to learn something about it!<br><br><strong>Who does it apply to?</strong></p><ul><li><p>To every person who supplies goods and/or services of value exceeding Rs 20 lakh in a financial year. (Limit is Rs 10 lakh for some special category states). Compulsory registration for these.

Below are some reasons why you should learn Deep learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2652488/preview/?startPreviewId=21007462", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4606632", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Management", "title": "Postgraduate Diploma: Project Management", "content_length": "89", "level": "All Levels", "author": "The Retail Banking School", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "207", "students": "12800", "coupon_code": "A7A974FC37EBC2FC87D2", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4606632_2a39.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/project-managers/?couponCode=A7A974FC37EBC2FC87D2", "expired_date": "2022-09-07 07:23:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "330", "headline": "Introduction to main areas and tools of project management", "description": "<p><strong>Working principles of project management. </strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Short Description:</strong> Course will be interesting to anybody who want to learn about the required skills for work of project manager and how to enhance the skills within project management.

We plan on updating this course so that you can continue to use it as a reference even as QuickBooks Online evolves its software. We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online. We will go over each option in more detail in the course.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial, perfect to practice with</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They also often offer a student version, which may provide more extended access to the software, and this would be great considering we will be covering a comprehensive problem.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>QuickBooks also provides a free test drive file.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the course will discuss how to access QuickBooks Online, the accounting software options QuickBooks offers, and set up our QuickBooks file.</p><p>We will then practice navigating the accounting software, the free QuickBooks Online Test Drive File being our primary tool. When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/1517986/preview/?startPreviewId=27837500", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2410998", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Web Development", "title": "HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap - Certification Course for Beginners", "content_length": "408", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "YouAccel Training", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "1831", "students": "115469", "coupon_code": "YOUACCEL92823", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2410998_275d_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/html-css-bootstrap-certification-course-for-beginners/?couponCode=YOUACCEL92823", "expired_date": "2022-09-11 03:12:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "132", "headline": "A Complete Guide for Beginners interested in learning HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap for Building Stylish, Responsive Web Pages.", "description": "<p>This course covers three essential concepts for aspiring Web Developers. This includes HTML, CSS, &amp;&nbsp;Bootstrap. Each section comes complete with comprehensive lessons that help students master the art of front-end coding. </p><p>The course is divided as follows:</p><p><strong>HTML Development</strong></p><p>This section explores HTML. HTML is a key fundamental building block when learning to develop websites. Students initially learn the basics of HTML page structure and gradually transition into working with spacing, text formatting, lists, images, videos, links, anchors, tables, forms and much more. We include several projects, where students are shown first-hand, how to develop and code html web pages from scratch.</p><p><strong>CSS Development</strong></p><p>Students learn to use CSS to create stylish, responsive web page layouts. We start by discussing the parts and types of CSS rules, followed by CSS classes, DIVS, and ID's. Students gain significant exposure to various formatting options, including margins, padding, font properties, backgrounds, transparency, positioning, link styling and CSS tables. This section includes a hands-on web development project where students utilize the concepts explored in the lesson.</p><p><strong>Bootstrap Framework</strong></p><p>Students are taught to use the Bootstrap framework for responsive, mobile-first - front-end development. As one of the leading open-source development libraries, Bootstrap is an essential part of the developers coding arsenal. The section begins with teaching students how to include essential Bootstrap files into web pages. It then explores the Bootstrap Grid system and popular layout strategies for optimal cross-device and cross-browser compatibility.</p><p>Students gain exposure to just about every Bootstrap component, from typography, tables and images, to jumbotrons, wells, alerts, buttons, glyphicons and progress bars. The section includes several hands-on exercises that will walk students through the process of creating stunning layouts, complete with modals, carousels, popovers, drop-down menus, forms and much more.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2410998/preview/?startPreviewId=31732104", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4356628", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "1Z0-1094-22 Oracle Cloud Database Migration and Integration.", "content_length": "0", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Mundhar Masan", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "134", "students": "5937", "coupon_code": "B1BC163EA71BC7DCC5E6", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4356628_00ee.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/1z0-1094-21-oracle-cloud-database-migration-and-integration-x/?couponCode=B1BC163EA71BC7DCC5E6", "expired_date": "2022-09-06 13:25:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "655", "headline": "1Z0-1094-22 exam Oracle Cloud Database Migration and Integration Specialist", "description": "<p> 1Z0-1094-22 exam Oracle Cloud Database Migration and Integration Specialist</p><p><br></p><p>Migrating Oracle Databases is a critical component of all application migrations.

This part starts with a concise conversation of such ideas as wrongdoing, criminal, degenerate, criminal science, law enforcement, and agreement and struggle viewpoints of criminology. The accompanying segment presents an overall rundown of the unique phases of the grown-up law enforcement system, as well as the adolescent equity. The first section of our Criminology and Criminal psychology training presents a general summary of the different stages of the criminal justice system, as well as the justice system. Next, this section illustrates how criminology informs policies and programs. Unfortunately, there are instances when policies are not founded<br>on criminological theory and rigorous research, but are more of an interesting reaction to perceived problems. The second section provides an overview of victimology and various issues related to victims of crime.</p><p>Crime, like so many things in our social world, has a certain taken-for-granted or common-sense nature. When we use the term, we assume the category is meaningful; that is, we assume that those to whom we are talking will understand what we\u2019re</p><p>talking about and will tend to use the term in the same way as we do. This, of course, is the basis upon which the social world operates on assumptions about the taken-for-granted meaningfulness of the vocabulary we use and the behaviours we enact. The word <em>crime </em>is used regularly in everyday conversation. That it is used in this manner implies that there is a sufficient level of common understanding for it to be meaningful. On one level, this is undoubtedly the case.</p><p>However, this masks a number of complexities.

It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for <em>Personal Home Page</em>, but it now stands for the recursive initialism <em>PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor</em>.</p><p>PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon, or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code \u2013 which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data \u2013 would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted and executed via a command-line interface (CLI).</p><p>The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of charge.</p><p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the <em>de facto</em> standard which other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.</p><p>As of January 2021, 72% of PHP websites use discontinued versions of PHP, i.e. PHP 7.2 or lower, which are no longer supported by The PHP Development Team. A large additional fraction uses PHP 7.3, which is only (up to December 6, 2021) \"supported for critical security issues only.\" Over 40% of all PHP websites use version 5.6 or older, which not even Debian supports (Debian 9 supported version 7.0 and 7.1).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Beginner Friendliness</strong></p><p><strong>Easy to Get Started With</strong></p><p>PHP was designed to make web development easier, and many beginners find it effortless to pick up and get started with. In fact, PHP code was so easy to pick up, many non-programmers end up being able to hack PHP code together without truly understanding the code. While good programmers will never copy and paste code they don't understand, this speaks volumes about how easy it is to pick up PHP.</p><p>The latest version of PHP (PHP8) has fixed a lot of inconsistencies and fatal errors as well. PHP has a wealth of learning resources, but you should make sure to avoid outdated tutorials.</p><p><strong>Flexible</strong></p><p>PHP is a dynamically typed language. This means there are no hard rules on how to build features, and you'll have more flexibility solving problems using different methods. Furthermore, PHP is also more forgiving of errors, so you'll still be able to compile and run your program until you hit the problematic part.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3950826/preview/?startPreviewId=35940996", "language": "Arabic"}, {"course_id": "4525712", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "E-Commerce", "title": "Myyshop - 90% margin dropshipping strategy and program", "content_length": "116", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Myyshop E-learning", "rating": "3.3", "reviews": "3", "students": "3025", "coupon_code": "C20DAD51EF902E212DB7", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4525712_2bb3_10.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2022-how-to-win-dropshipping-by-3v-formula-with-tight-budget/?couponCode=C20DAD51EF902E212DB7", "expired_date": "2022-09-10 03:03:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "248", "headline": "My real success case, and big lesson after 5 years dropshipping, VERY VACANT VIRAL", "description": "<p><strong>How to Really Earn Shopify dropshipping with tight budget ? 6 figures E-com seller Formula : VERY VACANT VIRAL (we sell on Amazon Shopify DHgate...total 500 000 usd per month, proof inside)</strong></p><p>How to start and really WIN IN drop shipping?

These gases, mainly carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, have increased in concentration in recent years in the atmosphere because of fossil fuel combustion, agriculture and livestock, and deforestation.</p><p>These gases hold solar radiation and increase the earth's temperature, which leads to global warming which eventually causes climate change. The increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the air causes also oceans acidification.</p><p>Climate change generates a lot of unwanted effects on many levels such as Extreme weather event intensification like floods and droughts, melting of ice caps and glaciers, propagation of diseases and pests, habitat destruction, coral bleaching, and many social and economic impacts.</p><p>Thus, we organized the course on climate change into <em>three parts</em> :</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Part one</strong> discusses direct causes of climate change, mainly fossil energy, agriculture, and deforestation, and indirect causes like capitalism, corporate lobbying, cryptocurrency, and science deniers.

We hope that you feel this exam challenges you, teaches you, and prepares you to pass the AWS Certified Database - Specialty. If this is your first study guide, take a moment to relax. This could be the first step to a new high-paying job and an AMAZING career. If you\u2019ve been around the block a few times, consider taking a moment and answering some questions from newer techies. After all, it\u2019s our great community that illuminates the material and helps build something great.</p><p><strong>What Should You Know Before Studying The AWS Certified Database - Specialty?</strong></p><p>Every exam and certification has different requirements. If this is a serious venture, make sure to read the prerequisites before preceding. Nothing is worse than wasting months studying for an exam you can\u2019t take or passing an exam that won\u2019t help you get a certification! Our easy search tools are designed to help you find relevant information as well and search for a variety of different exams.</p><p><strong>What Is The AWS Certified Database - Specialty Focused On?</strong></p><p>The AWS Certified Database - Specialty or as it\u2019s also known, the <em>AWS Certified Database - Specialty</em>, like all tests, there is a bit of freedom on Amazon's part to exam an array of subjects. That means knowing the majority of AWS Certified Database - Specialty content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the AWS Certified Database - Specialty but it may take some extra work.</p><p><strong>Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day</strong></p><p>Remember that incredible things take time. And just like ancient monuments took years of effort, certification is not easy. It is not always quick either. But it is worth it! Our toolset allows you to engage with an incredible community of expert tech workers and add to the conversation. If you have questions, don\u2019t forget to leave a comment and reach out. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll get personalized help unheard of on test prep sites, without the outrageous fees.</p><p><strong>Always Check The Foundation</strong></p><p>Some certifications have requirements going back to older exams, while others use two or more tests to help someone pass. If you find the AWS Certified Database - Specialty is over your head, that\u2019s ok. It might make sense to see if a lower level exam will give you some clarity.</p><p><strong>If Offered, Read The Exam Objectives</strong></p><p>The exam objectives are different for every single exam and usually provided by the certification provider. These normally tell the test taker what subjects are relevant, what they need to know, and why the exam seeks to cover these topics. It\u2019s important to find them out for your specific exam. This can be found on nearly every vendor website and greatly informs the way you\u2019ll study! Don\u2019t worry though, we have taken those objectives into account and seek to create a testing experience comparable to an actual exam.</p><p><strong>Remember That Certification Is Quite Rewarding</strong></p><p>It can be hard to keep your focus on studying but remember that the best jobs in the world are only a few tests away. Whether you enter Cyber Security or do entry level tech work, certification is a clear, learnable, and rewarding path to careers that pay a LOT of money. They offer better work-life balance and you\u2019ll get in with some of the major leaders in the business world. So don\u2019t give up, it is worth it, and all this work will pay off!</p><p><br></p><p>This credential helps organizations identify and develop talent with critical skills for implementing cloud initiatives.

The definition of Scrum consists of roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.</p><p>Scrum defines three roles, the Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team Member.</p><p>Scrum is:</p><ul><li><p>Lightweight</p></li><li><p>Simple to understand</p></li><li><p>Difficult to master</p></li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between Scrum and Agile Development?</strong></p><p>Agile Development is a software methodology, whereas Scrum is one of process frameworks that follows Agile. Scrum is advised to teams with experienced team members as the Framework requires great collaboration and self-organization as well. If the Scrum rules are not followed strictly, a project can lead to failure. Hence, it is necessary to have a proper understanding of Scrum concepts among the entire team.</p><p><strong>Why do we need Scrum?</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d it, per se.</p><p>But to be successful at building products and services which generate value for your customers and your business in rapidly changing circumstances, you do need a way of managing risk, optimizing value and navigating complexity in both the work and the surrounding environment. Scrum provides a framework for doing that.</p><p><strong>When should I choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum best serves the projects with unclear details and specifications, ones with high risk of mid-project changes, where there is a need to monitor the value of completed tasks throughout and where teams need autonomy and creativity to produce the best results.</p><p>With Scrum your team will:</p><ul><li><p>Deliver the main value quicker</p></li><li><p>Have a bigger chance of meeting the deadline</p></li><li><p>Create the product for less</p></li><li><p>Be more motivated</p></li><li><p>Collaborate better</p></li><li><p>Be more innovative and listen to client requirements more careful</p></li></ul><p><strong>When should I not choose Scrum?</strong></p><p>Scrum application can be complicated in large teams or those very attached to the traditional process. It will also not be a good fit for those that expect a light and quick change into better results. Otherwise, it simply takes determination and will to take on the process and adapt it to your needs.</p><p><strong>Is Scrum Master a job title or a role that someone with an existing job title fills?</strong></p><p>Scrum Master is a role that someone with a job title fills. Normal practice is that the person playing the role of project manager plays the ScrumMaster\u2019s role as well.</p><p><strong>Can Product Owner and ScrumMaster\u2019s roles be played by the same person?</strong></p><p>No, since the ownership differs. The role of Product Owner and ScrumMaster are very much mutually exclusive. Product Owner takes care of the Product Backlog, Prioritization of User Stories, and Validation of the working product increment with the user stories allocated to the Sprint.</p><p><strong>How might Scrum work for research projects?</strong></p><p>Scrum can be applied to any project where the goal is to maximize the value of something (a \u201cproduct\u201d), and thus requires short feedback loops in order to govern what actually gets delivered and ends up being valuable. Research fits nicely in this category because, by definition, it is about learning something in order to achieve a broader purpose.</p><p><strong>What about Professional Scrum Certification?</strong></p><p>There are various Professional Scrum Certifications available including <strong>Professional Scrum Master\u2122, Professional Scrum Product Owner\u2122, Professional Scrum Developer\u2122, Scaled Professional Scrum\u2122, Professional Scrum\u2122 with Kanban, Professional Agile Leadership\u2122 and Professional Scrum\u2122 with User Experience.</strong></p><p>These assessments cover a range of areas related to the knowledge and real world usage of Scrum. Passing these credible and consistent assessments is highly regarded as true industry certification by individuals, organizations and industry associations.</p><p>You can visit the official Scrum website for more details.</p><p>---------------</p><p>Let's get started.

Explore Virtualization, Scaling, Elastic IPs, + More", "description": "<p>Welcome to the Amazon EC2 Foundations Certification course. This course provides an in-depth overview of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). The EC2 service is an essential building block in becoming an AWS certified cloud practitioner. We will start with exploring key concepts relevant to EC2, followed by a hands-on practical guide to deploying compute resources on AWS. <br><br>The term \u201cScalable Cloud Computing\u201d has now become synonymous with Amazon Web Services. For nearly a decade, AWS has been powering some of the world\u2019s most popular websites and applications. Amazon EC2, is considered the computational backbone of AWS.<br><br>To illustrate how Amazon EC2 works, we explore the concept of virtualization. Virtualization is the process of creating a software-based virtual representation of a server. When we deploy an EC2 \u201cInstance\u201d we\u2019re creating a virtual representation of a physical server and it\u2019s resources.<strong> </strong>This includes: CPU, Memory (RAM), Storage, and network resources such as Bandwidth. <br><br>Similar to physical servers that you might find on-premises,<strong> </strong>virtual EC2 instances can also have different configurations. As a matter of fact, AWS offers the most comprehensive configuration options when it comes to deploying virtual servers.<strong> </strong>These configurations can easily be adapted to our resource needs, in real-time.<br><br>The level of customization a cloud provider can accommodate, will define the sophistication level of it\u2019s overall service. Not all cloud services were created equal. AWS, is known to have the highest level of configuration options when compared to just about any other service. The AWS platform caters to both micro and enterprise level clients, using one of the most scalable and advanced virtualization infrastructures available.<br><br>Beyond the physical hardware customization and scalability, virtualization also accommodates the deployment of any operating system on the virtual machine. As you will see, we have the flexibility of deploying both Linux and Windows servers, using a variety of pre-configured virtual applications known as AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).</p><p>In addition to a theoretical deep dive into Amazon EC2, this course will also provide you with practical hands-on experience in working with the key features of EC2. This includes:</p><ul><li><p>Exploring the characteristics of EC2 Instances.</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Types</p></li><li><p>Creating IAM Users for EC2</p></li><li><p>Deploying EC2 Instances with pre-configured AMIs</p></li><li><p>Assigning Elastic IP's to Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>EC2 Instance Administration </p></li><li><p>Creating Security Groups for Deployed Instances</p></li><li><p>Remote EC2 Administration using SSH Utilities like Terminal for MAC, and PuTTY&nbsp;for Windows.</p></li><li><p>Using EC2 Instance Connect to administer instances. </p></li></ul><p>If you're interested in learning how to deploy and administer virtual machines on the most robust cloud computing platform, hit the enroll button and let's jump right in.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4366450/preview/?startPreviewId=37126332", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3959540", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "Introduction to Reverse Osmosis Desalination", "content_length": "47", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Green Courses", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "23", "students": "5943", "coupon_code": "532D83337B3E58B047A7", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3959540_2085_5.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/introduction-to-reverse-osmosis-desalination/?couponCode=532D83337B3E58B047A7", "expired_date": "2022-09-06 16:57:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "364", "headline": "In this course, you will learn about reverse osmosis desalination technology basics and aspects.", "description": "<p>Desalination is a recurrent term in our era.

Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this.

Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website. In the special lecture, we will be exploring a tool that allows you to share the recordings as a podcast and monetise them, also.</p><p>Why wait? We advise you to try out the social audio platforms taught in the course, keep an ear out for advertising opportunities, and start thinking about how to engage with your audiences or fans in an audible way - whatsoever.</p><p>1....2....3.....Enroll Now.

Consider how much time you spend applying for employment only to receive a rejection letter a week or a month later.&nbsp;You must be already aware of the problems and challenges that every job applicant like you face.</p><p>The spectacle over whether artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs is heating up. According to AI sceptics, statistical models lack the creativity and intuition of human employees and are hence destined to do specialised, repetitive tasks. While AI has already displaced roughly 700,000 jobs in the United States alone between 2006 and 2022, with another 5 million on the way, AI is now automating the economy in a far more subtle way. </p><p>This course has the potential to convey the power of AI in a more positive way that will put a ding in the corporate universe - thanks to the technology developed especially for job-seekers to create a mark.&nbsp;In fact, now people are predicting that Automation may trigger a lot of growth for India and the rest of the world in the years 2022-2026.</p><p>Now, let us try to answer the biggest question.</p><p><strong>\"Do you spend a lot of time looking for jobs only to receive no good feedback or reaction from recruiters or hiring managers after weeks and in fact months of waiting?\"</strong>. It can be really disheartening and even disappointing at times, especially if you keep applying and receiving fewer or no responses. Job hunting is a difficult and time-consuming procedure whatsoever. But, wait, automation technology might have a solution after all. <strong><em>Automation</em></strong> can definitely increase productivity, improve efficiency, reduce time and effort.&nbsp;In most cases, the automation tools learn themselves from the mistakes that occurred in the past and reduce the future chance of errors happening. </p><p>This mind-blowing course created by&nbsp;<strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" </strong>and <strong>\"First Look Digital Marketing Solutions\"</strong> is going to change the facet of technology to bring forth a revolution in the job-search and application process using the power of the LazyApply platform. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;You will save 100's of hours of time by automating the job-search/application process A-Z as you learn and master the automation procedure of applying to jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed. You will realize that you are learning about a Smart AI that automatically fills the job applications based on the information provided. It's just like a personal assistant working for you to speed up the game to skyrocket your career to the maximum potential.&nbsp;You will also learn the secrets of why to automate your job search - the actual need inside this course.</p><p>Enroll now.&nbsp;Start learning this craft to propel your life and career.&nbsp;1. 2. 3.&nbsp;Time for Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4567264/preview/?startPreviewId=39621982", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2512030", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Audit - Financial Statement", "content_length": "1098", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "1615", "students": "59459", "coupon_code": "AA8D72BC39ABCB294129", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2512030_67fb.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/audit-financial-statement/?couponCode=AA8D72BC39ABCB294129", "expired_date": "2022-09-07 01:31:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "447", "headline": "Learn the audit process from planning to audit report form a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).", "description": "<p>Audit-Financial Accounting will discuss, in detail, the auditing process of financial statements.</p><p>The course will start by discussing what an audit is, as well as what the terms attest engagement and assurances services mean.</p><p>We will discuss the audit environment, the general format of a public accounting firm, and the general format of an audit team that would conduct the procedures related to an audit. The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1.

This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames, passwords,\u00a0credit cards and other sensitive\u00a0information.\u00a0<br><br>In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive, and eventually highlighted in red, bold colors on the address bar.\u00a0<br><br>It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time, money and energy to drive traffic to your website. Your users expect a secure browsing experience and will likely be deterred from using your page when they see such warning labels attached.\u00a0<br><br>There is a common misconception that securing a webpage over HTTPS requires expert server knowledge and is a costly and cumbersome process.\u00a0<br><br>The purpose of this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about HTTPS and SSL certificates. We start with the basics. Exploring the theory and definitions that will be useful in developing your understanding.\u00a0<br><br>From there, we dive into configuring a server on Digital Ocean and installing a free SSL certificate known as Let's Encrypt. We also explore setting up Cron Jobs on an Ubuntu server, to automatically renew your certificate periodically.\u00a0<br><br>After completing this course, you will easily be able to secure any web page using HTTPS and free SSL certificates.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/1139400/preview/?startPreviewId=7940694", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4852244", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "Google Cloud Professional Cloud Security Engineer Exam 2022", "content_length": "0", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "\u064a\u0648\u0646\u0633 \u0627\u0632\u0645\u0648\u0633", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "2", "students": "2738", "coupon_code": "56FB6760273B2433E9D4", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4852244_1254.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/google-cloud-professional-cloud-security-engineer-exam-2022/?couponCode=56FB6760273B2433E9D4", "expired_date": "2022-09-07 01:02:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "263", "headline": "Full Practice Test with Explanations included!", "description": "<ul><li><p><strong>Welcome!</strong></p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p>I'm here to help you prepare to pass the newest <strong>Google Cloud Professional Cloud Security Engineer </strong>Exam.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li><p><strong>Why taking these practice exams ?<br><br></strong></p><ol><li><p>This is a huge <strong>original question bank</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>MOBILE-COMPATIBLE - so you can conveniently review everywhere, anytime with your smartphone!</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>30 Day money back guarantee</strong> - Not satisfied?

We will understand the importance of different libraries such as Numpy, Pandas &amp; Seaborn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 2 (Section 3-6) - ANN Theoretical Concepts</strong></p><p>This part will give you a solid understanding of concepts involved in Neural Networks.</p><p>In this section you will learn about the single cells or Perceptrons and how Perceptrons are stacked to create a network architecture. Once architecture is set, we understand the Gradient descent algorithm to find the minima of a function and learn how this is used to optimize our network model. </p></li><li><p><strong>Part 3 (Section 7-11) - Creating ANN model in Python</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn how to create ANN models in Python.</p><p>We will start this section by creating an ANN model using Sequential API to solve a classification problem. We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>We also understand the importance of libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow in this part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 4 (Section 12) - CNN Theoretical Concepts</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn about convolutional and pooling layers which are the building blocks of CNN models.</p><p>In this section, we will start with the basic theory of convolutional layer, stride, filters and feature maps. We also explain how gray-scale images are different from colored images. Lastly we discuss pooling layer which bring computational efficiency in our model.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 5 (Section 13-14) - Creating CNN model in Python<br></strong>In this part you will learn how to create CNN models in Python.</p><p>We will take the same problem of recognizing fashion objects and apply CNN model to it. We will compare the performance of our CNN&nbsp;model with our ANN model and notice that the accuracy increases by 9-10% when we use CNN. However, this is not the end of it. We can further improve accuracy by using certain techniques which we explore in the next part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 6 (Section 15-18) - End-to-End Image Recognition project in Python<br></strong>In this section we build a complete image recognition project on colored images.</p><p>We take a Kaggle image recognition competition and build CNN&nbsp;model to solve it. With a simple model we achieve nearly 70% accuracy on test set. Then we learn concepts like Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning which help us improve accuracy level from 70% to nearly 97% (as good as the winners of that competition).</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a Convolutional Neural Network model in Python will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use CNN to create predictive models and solve image recognition problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below are some popular FAQs of students who want to start their Deep learning journey-</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use Python for Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Deep Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Deep Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2737836/preview/?startPreviewId=21812052", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3729928", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Career Development", "title": "Automate your Job-Search with LoopCV in 2022", "content_length": "42", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "rating": "3.7", "reviews": "102", "students": "38638", "coupon_code": "LOOPCVGOESVIRAL", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3729928_d20a_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/automate-your-job-search-with-loopcv/?couponCode=LOOPCVGOESVIRAL", "expired_date": "2022-09-11 03:52:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "671", "headline": "A world-changing online course focussed on job-search automation with LoopCV in 2022", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience \"</em><strong>Automate your Job-Search with LoopCV in 2022\"</strong>.</p><p><strong>Just imagine, how much time do you spend applying to jobs and all you get is a rejection letter after a week or a month's time?</strong></p><p>Let's get this right as we elaborate on this problem faced by every job-seeker out there.</p><p>Do you actually spend a lot of time applying to a job, only to wait for weeks without any kind of positive feedback or response from recruiters and hiring managers?&nbsp;It can get really depressing, whatsoever at one point in time when you keep on repeatedly applying and you only get fewer responses or no responses at all.&nbsp;Job-seeking is complicated and a time-consuming process.&nbsp;But, wait technology may have an answer to this problem.</p><p>We know it - technology has never progressed as quickly or as far as it is today.

Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.</p></li><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basics, try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>What is BigQuery used for?</strong></p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong> is a web service from Google that is <strong>used for</strong> handling or analyzing big data. Google BigQuery is part of the Google Cloud Platform. As a NoOps (no operations) data analytics service, <strong>Google BigQuery</strong> offers users the ability to manage data using fast SQL-like queries for real-time analysis.</p><p><strong>Is BigQuery free?</strong></p><p>For users of Google BigQuery the first 10GB of storage per month is free and the first 1TB of query per month is free. Post these limits, Google BigQuery is chargeable.</p><p><strong>Which is better, PostgreSQL or MySQL?</strong></p><p>Both are excellent products with unique strengths, and the choice is often a matter of personal preference.</p><p>PostgreSQL offers overall features for traditional database applications, while MySQL focuses on faster performance for Web-based applications.</p><p>Open source development will bring more features to subsequent releases of both databases.</p><p><strong>Who uses these databases?</strong></p><p>Here are a few examples of companies that use PostgreSQL: Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype.</p><p>Google BigQuery is used by companies such as Spotify, The New York Times, Stack Etc.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3202534/preview/?startPreviewId=25403137", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1969570", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Entrepreneurship", "title": "QuickBooks Pro Desktop -Bookkeeping Business-Easy Way", "content_length": "901", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "167", "students": "23755", "coupon_code": "E7A34FCF6A5D547C80AE", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1969570_ba94_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-pro-bookkeeping-the-easy-way-for-small-businesses/?couponCode=E7A34FCF6A5D547C80AE", "expired_date": "2022-09-10 02:45:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "736", "headline": "QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019 bookkeeping business plan and examples, walking through bookkeeping engagement & data entry", "description": "<p><strong>QuickBooks pro desktop 2019 bookkeeping business designed for small business clients or small businesses who want a simple cash basis format for entering data.\u00a0 </strong></p><p><strong>This course is designed for bookkeepers and is also useful for small business owners who want a simple system for entering financial data into QuickBooks for financial planning and year-end tax preparation. </strong></p><p>The bookkeeping system we discuss will also describe the relationship between the bookkeeper, the business, and the year-end tax and financial statement preparers. </p><p>We will outline a cash basis bookkeeping system using QuickBooks, a system that will enter most transactions directly into the check register. </p><p>The course will discuss the responsibilities of a bookkeeper and the responsibilities of the business when a bookkeeping engagement in entered into.\u00a0 </p><p>We will work through a sample bookkeeping project in QuickBooks including the setting up of a new QuickBooks company file. </p><p>The course will practice entering data into the QuickBooks register directly from a bank statement.

The remote workers can store and <strong>share documents, spreadsheets, and slide presentations.</strong> It can be used for reporting on weekly metrics. Additionally, Google Drive files can be synced across devices, so the individuals can view and update them from anywhere.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 2 - Google Docs</strong></p><p><strong>Google Docs</strong> is a word processor included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 3 - Google Slides</strong></p><p>Google Slides is a presentation program included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 4 - Google Sheets</strong></p><p>Google Sheets is a spreadsheet program included as part of a free, web-based software office suite offered by Google within its Google Drive service.

Trello is built around the notion of bulletin boards. Each board can represent a project, for example. Within each board, teams create lists, which they then populate with cards. The cards can be assigned to specific team members, labeled, stamped with a deadline, and crammed with comments or attachments. The hierarchical nature of the system makes it flexible while still preserving a baseline simplicity.</p><p><br></p></li><li><p><strong>Section 6 - Zoom</strong></p><p>If you have big team meetings that include lots of remote workers, Zoom is a video chat application that supports dozens of participants. Large meetings with up to 500 participants are supported as an add-on feature.</p></li></ul><p><strong>How will this course help you?</strong></p><p>If you are a working professional who wants to learn about tools that help you work remotely with efficiency and high productivity, this course will introduce you to the most popular free online tools which will enable you to collaborate and work effectively even at your home.</p><p>A <strong>Verifiable Certificate of Completion</strong> is presented to all students who undertake this \"Tools for Working from Home\" course.</p><p><strong>Our Promise</strong></p><p>Teaching our students is our job and we are committed to it.
