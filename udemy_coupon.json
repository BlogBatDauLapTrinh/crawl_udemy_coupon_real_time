While digital technology has evolved over the years, we've switched from tv to the Internet, and we're integrating Artificial Intelligence seamlessly and slowly today. John McCarthy coined the term AI for the first time in 1956. It involves many of the main things that range from robotics process automation to the actual robotics process. Because of the amount of data these types of organizations are working with, it has become highly popular with large companies today. Increasing demand for information pattern awareness has contributed to growth in the AI market. AI models are much more successful at detecting information trends than people, which help companies understand and gain insight into their target audience. Thousands of businesses around the world see AI as the next big thing for the finance industry. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;can be used widely for financial transaction auditing systems. AI can also be a great help when it comes to processing a large number of pages for tax changes. Organizations dependent on AI can be expected to make major firm-related decisions in the near future. AI also has the ability to identify how consumers should respond to different circumstances and problems. Artificial Intelligence can help people and businesses make smarter choices at a very fast pace. But the key here is to find the right human-machine balance.</p><p>Get ready to go wow.

To Think Creatively Like Walt Disney\"</em></strong></p><p><strong>What would Walt Disney think?</strong></p><p>Although Disney has been gone for a long, you know that his company is still at the forefront of technological evolution. Frankly speaking, it was his marketing genius that set him and his company apart from everybody else on the planet. Now, I would like to re-incarnate Walt Disney into this course and put forth ideas from his perspective, imagining him to be your business coach, after all. What ideas Walt Disney would bring to your table if he lived now?</p><p>Yes, truly it started with a mouse and marketing - in the beginning.</p><p>Walt Disney may have created Mickey Mouse - but none of his success would have been possible without his marketing ingenuity. With the genius in him, he filled up movie theatres, theme parks and sold tons of Disney merchandise. Without Disney, there would be no Disney World and no family entertainment parks. He was the marketing genius for the 20th century!</p><p>While Disney went a bit overboard with his marketing, it's not like he didn't have some great ideas though. Walt Disney had amazing visions, but he was never very good at verbalising them. </p><p>Before that, think of all the big concepts created and promoted today through successful marketing. You should have the mantra that should be branded with your company. Let's take \"Think Different as an example of Apple Inc.\" First introduced in 1997 with this slogan, Apple has transformed into a multimillion-dollar business. The idea is simply to break away from conventional thinking and adapt to technology, customer needs and competition.</p><p>You have all these new ideas in your business, but how do you communicate them to the world? You need an ad campaign to get your idea out there too to reach the masses. Now, let's talk about how this course can be a differentiator when it comes to innovation and thinking like Walt&nbsp;Disney.</p><p><strong>Why enrol for this mind-blowing course \"Innovation 1.0\" that has the power to change the world of innovation forever?</strong></p><p>Your content marketing campaign is vital to the success of your organisation. You will know that the way you present your company's brand shapes people's views of your organisation. Times may have changed since Walt Disney's days but his marketing ideas are still an element of brilliance. Let's take a look at a few tactics from Walt Disney\u2019s angle to push your business idea to success.)</p><p>In the superb course, you will learn how Walt Disney would think about any idea about a product/service. We will be focussing on Disney\u2019s creative strategy which has the root cause of the success of the company and of course, Walt Disney, the man, the myth and the legend - himself.</p><p>I guarantee that this course is unlike any course you\u2019ve ever taken. It definitely helps in showcasing the most fantastic and absurd ideas possible from Disney\u2019s perspective and also focuses on how you can apply the same principles of Walt Disney to enjoy renewed and continuous business success.</p><p><strong>Welcome to My Class and Evoke the Brilliance of Disney</strong></p><p>Enrol now.

This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology. Time to shine.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2494498/preview/?startPreviewId=19322958", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1998896", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "Other IT & Software", "title": "QuickBooks Payroll - QuickBooks Pro Desktop", "content_length": "1376", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "103", "students": "10297", "coupon_code": "13BFA6B6F6B2C033DD1A", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1998896_a9d3_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-payroll-quickbooks-pro-desktop-2019/?couponCode=13BFA6B6F6B2C033DD1A", "expired_date": "2022-10-11 03:41:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "822", "headline": "Processing QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019 payroll for a small business, generating paychecks, processing payroll tax forms", "description": "<p><strong>QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2019 payroll will describe the payroll process for a small business in detail, so bookkeepers, accountants, and business owners can better understand how to set up payroll, process payroll, and troubleshoot problems related to payroll. </strong></p><p><strong>This course will introduce the payroll set-up in the QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2019 system, walking through payroll screens for both the paid version and the free manual version of payroll within QuickBooks Desktop. </strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss payroll legislation that will affect payroll calculations within QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019 and list the payroll forms we will need to generate from Quickbooks. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will walk through the process of entering a new employee into the QuickBooks Desktop Pro 2019 system and describe where the data would be received from in practice including Form W-4. </strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss Federal Income Tax (FIT) calculations within QuickBooks Pro Desktop 2019.

SEO has two key objectives. The first is to help you understand what online users are looking for - so that you can create high-quality content to serve their purpose. The second is to help you create a website that will be able to find, index, and understand its content through search engines. SEO can also put oneself ahead of the competition. If three or four websites are selling the same thing, the search-engine-optimized&nbsp;(SEO) ranked website is more likely to have more customers and make more sales.</p><p>The first stage in&nbsp;SEO&nbsp;is called \"technical SEO\" in the process. Technical SEO, as the name suggests, has little to do with a website's actual content or with methods of website promotion.</p><p>To make the job of search engine crawlers easier, it has to do with settings you need to customise. Usually, you do not have to deal with it again until you got your professional SEO right.</p><p>On-Page SEO is the second stage or step. On-Page SEO mainly has to do with the content and other elements found on a page.</p><p>The main objective of on-page SEO, unlike technical and off-page SEO, is to provide appropriate signals to search engine crawlers so that they can understand the importance and meaning of your content.</p><p>Note that content optimization is part of SEO on the website, but this is often referred to as \"SEO content\".</p><p>Off-Page SEO deals with primarily \"Backlinks\". Backlinks are a sign of confidence and they can dramatically influence your ranking status depending on where the links come from. Your ranking would be favourably impacted if the links come from well-known and trustworthy pages. Your ranking would be adversely affected whether they are paying links, links in article directories, link farms, or a consequence of an exchange.&nbsp;Also, digital marketers should note that if the website rankings and organic traffic are growing, you are in the right direction, then this implies.

Simply put,If you want to access databases then yes, you need to know SQL.</p></li><li><p>It is not really difficult to learn SQL. SQL is not a programming language, it\u2019s a query language. The primary objective where SQL was created was to give the possibility to common people get interested data from database. It is also an English like language so anyone who can use English at a basic level can write SQL query easily.</p></li><li><p>SQL is one of the most sought-after skills by hiring employers.</p></li><li><p>You can earn good money</p></li></ol><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn SQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn SQL quickly starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to learn SQL quickly.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to learn SQL?</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start learning from the basics of SQL. The first 10 sections of the course cover the basics.</p></li><li><p>Once done with the basics, try your hands on advanced SQL. Next 10 sections cover Advanced topics</p></li><li><p>Practice your learning on the exercise provided in every section.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What's the difference between SQL and PostgreSQL?</strong></p><p>SQL is a language. Specifically, the \"Structured Query Language\"</p><p>PostgreSQL is one of several database systems, or RDMS (Relational Database Management System). PostgresSQL is one of several RDMS's, others of which are Oracle, Informix, MySQL, and MSQL.</p><p>All of these RDMSs use SQL as their language. Each of them have minor variations in the \"dialect\" of SQL that they use, but it's all still SQL.</p><p><strong>What is BigQuery used for?</strong></p><p><strong>BigQuery</strong> is a web service from Google that is <strong>used for</strong> handling or analyzing big data.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement.

Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

According to a report by McKinsey, the civil construction sector has a net worth of more than $15 trillion a year, and while it has one of the largest consumer bases, until 2022, the industry had been relatively under digitised. This is because civil engineering is one of the few fields in which basic practices of bricklaying and pouring concrete have remained the same over the century leveraging traditional methods. However, the construction sector is set to undergo yet another industrial revolution, one powered by technology, particularly artificial intelligence for that matter.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence technologies are now being used by practising engineers to solve a whole range of problems. Future advancements in Artificial Neural Network (ANN), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms will mean that the civil engineering and construction industry will benefit in terms of optimisation which is the foremost factor, speed of processes and cost reduction, while young inexperienced engineers will be replaced by AI robots &amp; technologies.</p><p>When one mentions artificial intelligence in civil engineering, a picture of robots driving trucks and laying bricks may come to your mind. On the contrary, these techniques have more sophisticated applications in construction management, design optimisation, risk control, and quality control. This part 1 course in Tamil will teach you basic and advanced concepts for civil engineers that will provide significant value-adds to their careers. It will also help to make any construction business more lucrative through the usage of tools, practical concepts and techniques. As technology evolves, one can expect, along with computer technology, the genetic algorithm in civil engineering applications will be more general and more effective.</p><p>Enroll now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2498008/preview/?startPreviewId=19341364", "language": "Tamil"}, {"course_id": "2926664", "category": "Personal Development", "sub_category": "Personal Productivity", "title": "Productivity Powers Unleashed (2022 Edition)", "content_length": "57", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Srinidhi Ranganathan", "rating": "2.8", "reviews": "11", "students": "7189", "coupon_code": "PRODUCITIVITTZ", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2926664_e917_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/productivity-powers-unleashed/?couponCode=PRODUCITIVITTZ", "expired_date": "2022-10-12 02:32:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "654", "headline": "Get ready to boost your productivity to the maximum", "description": "<p><em>Welcome to experience </em><strong><em>\"</em>Productivity Powers Unleashed (2022 Edition)\".</strong></p><p>Paul J.&nbsp;Meyer once said that &nbsp;<strong>\"<em>Productivity is never an accident.

The tiny details can help him understand if the actual work can be completed within the proposed time frame and budget. It also enables him to decipher the probable cost that may be incurred for completion. Thereby, it is necessary to list the probable costs or develop an estimate for the proposed work from its plans and specifications and this is crucial. </p><p>An estimate can be prepared by calculating the quantities from the drawings for various items and multiplying them with the unit cost of the concerned item or items. Calculating this can help to work out the approximate cost of the project in order to decide its' feasibility with respect to the cost and to also ensure the financial resources - supposedly the proposal is actually approved.</p><p>From quantities of different items of work that are calculated in detailed estimation, resources can be nearly allocated to different activities of the project and the project's duration and whole planning and scheduling of the project will be carried out. Let's look at the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in the field of estimation.</p><p><strong><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;methods have been extensively used in the fields of civil engineering applications e.g. construction management, building materials, hydraulic optimisation, geotechnical and transportation engineering, and newly added EHS.</em></strong></p><p>Artificial intelligence technology nowadays plays a key role to improve and support the construction sector, Artificial intelligence (AI)&nbsp;usage in Civil promises an opportunity to transform the efficiency and quality of developments in various ways. This includes even \"Building Plan&nbsp;Processes\" that can be figured out through automated means. In the field of Civil Engineering, automated technology is considered a boon. Artificial machines will survey a potential construction site during the planning stages to gather enough data to generate 3D models, blueprints, and designs for development. It took weeks to complete that task. Now simply because of Artificial Intelligence new-age tools, the process only takes one day. This helps companies save time and money. In the construction industry, the design of Artificial Intelligence encourages the concept of fully automated construction sites, for that matter.</p><p>AI can assist in the layout review technique (e.G. Layout optimisation), bidding manner or method (e.G. Predictive fashions of evolution of raw fabric expenses) and postmortem evaluation (e.G. Natural language processing to become aware of comparable work consignments) with the aid of analysing tremendous amounts of inner unstructured information (inclusive of bidding documents) and outside information (along with commodity prices) to provide insights from previous tasks. In doing so, C &amp; I groups can generate greater accurate estimates, reducing budgets and timeline deviations via an expected 10-20% and engineering hours with the boost or aid of 10-30%.</p><p>Also, while nearly investments in information analytics can generate great potential value, success or fulfilment is not only about truly acquiring and integrating new era technologies; it\u2019s approximately growing an organisational strategy and culture that combine an insights-pushed approach to key selections, strategies and commercial enterprise models in a manner that enables the company to invest on the proper time and for the right reasons - for that matter.</p><p>This super-series-based course&nbsp;<strong>\"Crash Course on Civil Engineering and AutoCAD: Part 2\"&nbsp;</strong> taught by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi Ranganathan\" and Civil&nbsp;Engineering Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\" will teach you incredible calculating or estimation methods for brickwork and&nbsp;plastering work through manual and automated means.&nbsp;The course also brings awareness of an Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) in&nbsp;Civil Engineering platform that allows anyone to design and manufacture their own product, plan or build, or plan.&nbsp;We will also talk about the purpose of \"estimation\" and its importance.</p><p><em>Everyone indulging in the civil engineering profession will clearly think of these reasons, i.e. the fixed amount of funds, costly labour (skilled and unqualified), difficulty in getting good building materials, particularly cement, and regular rising costs of concrete, bricks, timber, etc. Two important things are also needed in terms of economy and construction standards. Construction standards can be achieved through careful monitoring and selecting proper specifications, while planning is a must for the Economy. If known beforehand, the total quantity of different materials used in construction can help the planning of the economy and that's why this course is important to learn.</em></p><p>Sign up now and let's start learning this mind-blowing course and change your career with the power of technology and change the whole facet of estimation forever.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2667300/preview/?startPreviewId=21021126", "language": "English"}, {}, {"course_id": "3273578", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Software Testing", "title": "JUnit 5, Mockito, PowerMock, TDD, BDD & ATTD", "content_length": "240", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Andrii Piatakha", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "196", "students": "53943", "coupon_code": "8CA258C56F7C053F7C6B", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3273578_a5eb.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-for-developers/?couponCode=8CA258C56F7C053F7C6B", "expired_date": "2022-10-12 10:56:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "555", "headline": "Learn JUnit 5 (JUpiter) + libraries for unit and integration testing from scratch together with test-driven development", "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Testing for software engineers that includes the learning of JUnit 5, Mockito, PowerMock, and TDD&nbsp;approach.</strong></p><p><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

That's one of the reasons why the digital web is increasingly becoming the backbone of video.</p><p>In hopes of expanding their following, creators convert their work into a video for YouTube, like young actors flocking to Hollywood for more exposure.</p><p>Podcasts have quickly gained prominence in just the last few years. Most of the main reasons for this was the transition to smartphones; customers switch away from desktops and more frequently use handheld devices. Also, search engines adjust their algorithms to offer mobile priority, making it more important than ever for organizations to concentrate on web or app optimization. As people rely more on mobile devices, viewing, uploading, and listening to podcasts has been simpler than ever, wherever and whenever. Another factor fueling podcasts' success is the lack of time for people. We appear to be busier than ever and the reality makes it impossible to calm down, read a book, or even watch a TV show without interruption. People like multitasking and doing as much as possible, and podcasts make it easy to listen on a drive, on a hike, while doing housework, and so on. </p><p>This compelling course focussed on<strong> \"Space Render 2.0: Transform your podcast into videos (2022)\"</strong>, takes a step further from the previous courses in&nbsp;Level 3 to completely open a new path for users to focus on podcast creation, marketing, and monetization using automation tools.

Consider how much time you spend applying for employment only to receive a rejection letter a week or a month later.&nbsp;You must be already aware of the problems and challenges that every job applicant like you face.</p><p>The spectacle over whether artificial intelligence (AI) will eliminate jobs is heating up. According to AI sceptics, statistical models lack the creativity and intuition of human employees and are hence destined to do specialised, repetitive tasks. While AI has already displaced roughly 700,000 jobs in the United States alone between 2006 and 2022, with another 5 million on the way, AI is now automating the economy in a far more subtle way. </p><p>This course has the potential to convey the power of AI in a more positive way that will put a ding in the corporate universe - thanks to the technology developed especially for job-seekers to create a mark.&nbsp;In fact, now people are predicting that Automation may trigger a lot of growth for India and the rest of the world in the years 2022-2026.</p><p>Now, let us try to answer the biggest question.</p><p><strong>\"Do you spend a lot of time looking for jobs only to receive no good feedback or reaction from recruiters or hiring managers after weeks and in fact months of waiting?\"</strong>. It can be really disheartening and even disappointing at times, especially if you keep applying and receiving fewer or no responses. Job hunting is a difficult and time-consuming procedure whatsoever. But, wait, automation technology might have a solution after all. <strong><em>Automation</em></strong> can definitely increase productivity, improve efficiency, reduce time and effort.&nbsp;In most cases, the automation tools learn themselves from the mistakes that occurred in the past and reduce the future chance of errors happening. </p><p>This mind-blowing course created by&nbsp;<strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" </strong>and <strong>\"First Look Digital Marketing Solutions\"</strong> is going to change the facet of technology to bring forth a revolution in the job-search and application process using the power of the LazyApply platform. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;You will save 100's of hours of time by automating the job-search/application process A-Z as you learn and master the automation procedure of applying to jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed. You will realize that you are learning about a Smart AI that automatically fills the job applications based on the information provided.

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.</p><p>The general idea we want to keep in our mind is that businesses are looking to invest assets in order to receive a return. Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.</p><p>We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.</p><p>The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.</p>", "preview_video":

This course only focuses on content creation and content writing when you start a blog.</p><p><strong>CONTENT&nbsp;CREATION&nbsp;THAT'S COMPELLING AND&nbsp;INTERESTS&nbsp;READERS</strong></p><p>Many bloggers write boring content in hopes to have it rank in Google search. But that approach by itself is limited and it fails because you need high-quality content creation that perks the reader's interests, and keeps their attention. The longer your content keeps the reader's attention, the more likely they will read other pages of yours, buy your products, subscribe to your newsletter, or do anything else you want them to do.</p><p><strong>MAKE MONEY&nbsp;BLOGGING</strong></p><p>After you attract readers, get to come back regularly, and engage with your content, I'll show you how to make money blogging.

Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you. What's more?&nbsp;This course will also contain the Google Ads dashboard walkthrough taught by Srinidhi and video advertising campaign creation steps along with the report-seeking process.</p><p>It's time to become a Professional YouTube Advertising Expert in the fastest time possible ever!</p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p><p>Enroll now and let's start the magic.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4549894/preview/?startPreviewId=39456050", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2292573", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Process Costing System-Cost Accounting-Managerial Accounting", "content_length": "479", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.2", "reviews": "156", "students": "39391", "coupon_code": "F7858919EA7C6EC4531E", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2292573_2c39.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/process-costing-system-cost-accounting-managerial-accounting/?couponCode=F7858919EA7C6EC4531E", "expired_date": "2022-10-11 03:36:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "804", "headline": "Process costing system-managerial accounting or cost accounting including equivalent unit calculation & journal entries", "description": "<p>Process costing system \u2013 Cost Accounting \u2013 Managerial Accounting</p><p>We will start by introducing managerial accounting or cost accounting topics that apply to companies that manufacture using either a job cost system or a process cost system.</p><p>The course will describe classifications for costs and the importance of being able to classify costs in different ways.</p><p>We will list and describe an outline of the process costs go through as they flow through the accounting process in a manufacturing company.</p><p>The course will compare the two major systems used to track inventory costs in a manufacturing company, the job cost system, and the process costs system.

We learn how to do uni-variate analysis and bi-variate analysis then we cover topics like<strong> outlier treatment, missing value imputation, variable transformation and correlation.</strong></p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Section 5 - Regression Model</strong></p><p>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand it, it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures. We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results, what are other variations to the ordinary least squared method and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.</p><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a regression model in R will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use regression modelling to create predictive models and solve business problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below is a list of popular FAQs of students who want to start their Machine learning journey- </p><p><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Machine Learning is a field of computer science which gives the computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the R environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in R</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture in R where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use R for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Machine learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job. Adding R to your repertoire will make some projects easier \u2013 and of course, it\u2019ll also make you a more flexible and marketable employee when you\u2019re looking for jobs in data science.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/2236090/preview/?startPreviewId=17114940", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3941874", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Project Management", "title": "Contracts Management in Construction Projects", "content_length": "82", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Akhil Krishna", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "539", "students": "40815", "coupon_code": "CONTRACTSOCT22", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3941874_73be.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/contracts-management-in-construction-projects/?couponCode=CONTRACTSOCT22", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 12:54:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "317", "headline": "Contracts Management, Contract Administration, FIDIC, Bank Guarantees, Contracts, Letter Drafting, Quantity Surveying", "description": "<p>Every construction project is bound by a Contract.

Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.</p><p>The Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as \u201cA fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\".</p><p>Six Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time. Six Sigma aspires to do the following - in general:</p><ul><li><p>Determine a problem.</p></li><li><p>Gather information about the problem's occurrence process.</p></li><li><p>Develop prospective problem-solving data-driven solutions.</p></li><li><p>To determine the best alternative, put the solutions to the test.</p></li><li><p>Create a system that will allow you to maintain a long-term solution.</p></li><li><p>Analyze the data and make any necessary adjustments. </p></li></ul><p>Let's get down to what this online course talks about. This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma's emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).</p><p>Please note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn't according to the client's specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer's perspective using Six Sigma methodology.</p><p><strong>Why opt for this course - the proven game-changer?</strong></p><p>By completing this<strong> \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\"</strong>, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!</p><p><em>This mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don't want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.&nbsp;What's more?

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>What are the steps I should follow to be able to build a Machine Learning model?</strong></p><p>You can divide your learning process into 4 parts:</p><p>Statistics and Probability - Implementing Machine learning techniques require basic knowledge of Statistics and probability concepts. Second section of the course covers this part.</p><p>Understanding of Machine learning - Fourth section helps you understand the terms and concepts associated with Machine learning and gives you the steps to be followed to build a machine learning model</p><p>Programming Experience - A significant part of machine learning is programming. Python and R clearly stand out to be the leaders in the recent days. Third section will help you set up the Python environment and teach you some basic operations. In later sections there is a video on how to implement each concept taught in theory lecture in Python</p><p>Understanding of Linear Regression modelling - Having a good knowledge of Linear Regression gives you a solid understanding of how machine learning works. Even though Linear regression is the simplest technique of Machine learning, it is still the most popular one with fairly good prediction ability. Fifth and sixth section cover Linear regression topic end-to-end and with each theory lecture comes a corresponding practical lecture where we actually run each query with you.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Put simply, machine learning and data mining use the same algorithms and techniques as data mining, except the kinds of predictions vary. While data mining discovers previously unknown patterns and knowledge, machine learning reproduces known patterns and knowledge\u2014and further automatically applies that information to data, decision-making, and actions.</p><p>Deep learning, on the other hand, uses advanced computing power and special types of neural networks and applies them to large amounts of data to learn, understand, and identify complicated patterns. Automatic language translation and medical diagnoses are examples of deep learning.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3215305/preview/?startPreviewId=41143790", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4865436", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Money Management Tools", "title": "Personal Finance #5-Purchasing Strategies", "content_length": "402", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "1", "students": "3189", "coupon_code": "3482A62BD1E4DD34C5A3", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4865436_67e0.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/personal-finance-5-purchasing-strategies/?couponCode=3482A62BD1E4DD34C5A3", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 03:34:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "418", "headline": "Learn best practices for making long-term, large dollar amount, purchases from a Certified Public Accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will concentrate on large personal purchases, outlining buying strategies to make the best long-term purchase decisions.</p><p>Human beings are great at short-term decisions, those where we can hone down our habits, training our gut so that we can trust our gut during future similar discussions.</p><p>However, we are not as good at making decisions that impact multiple years into the future, in part because we do not make them as often, so we don't have the opportunity to train our gut the same way we do with short-term decisions.</p><p>With long-term decisions, we need a formal decision-making process instead of trusting our habits and gut.</p><p>We will not be focusing on a home purchase in this course, even though it is one of the most significant individual purchases because the home purchase is sufficiently complex to warrant its own course.

It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.</p><p>A Kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).</p><p>It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!</p><p>This course will help you explore how working on an Agile project using Kanban has benefits for your development team, your end users, and your organization as a whole.</p><p>We will identify various process flow related issues including too much work in progress, underutilization of resources, lengthy tasks, unequal sized tasks etc. using simple and easy to understand demonstrations on Kanban board.</p><p>We will not only identify these inefficiencies but also solve for the same by continuously improving the process flow using Kanban Board.</p><p>Here is a list of the topics we will cover in this course:</p><ul><li><p>Introduction to Kanban &amp; Kanban Board</p></li><li><p>Finding Inefficiencies in the Process</p></li><li><p>Limiting Work in Progress</p></li><li><p>Under utilization of Resources</p></li><li><p>Unequal Sized Tasks</p></li><li><p>Marking the Tasks</p></li><li><p>Other Inefficiencies/Issues</p></li></ul><p><em>Kanban Practices</em></p><ul><li><p>Defining Done</p></li><li><p>Daily Stand up</p></li><li><p>Specifying Rules</p></li></ul><p><em>Key Agile Concepts</em></p><ul><li><p>Understanding &amp; Creating <strong>User Stories, Theme &amp; Epic</strong></p></li><li><p>What is <strong>Product Backlog</strong></p></li><li><p>Difference between <strong>Product Backlog &amp; Product Roadmap</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of Agile</strong></p></li><li><p>How <strong>Estimation</strong> is done in Agile</p></li><li><p>Why <strong>Relative Estimation</strong> in Agile</p></li><li><p><strong>T-Shirt &amp; Fibonacci</strong> Estimation</p></li><li><p><strong>Planing Poker</strong> in Agile</p></li><li><p><strong>Understanding &amp; Creating Burn down Charts </strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Minimum Viable Product</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Team Velocity</strong></p></li></ul><p>This course is ideal for <strong>software developers, project managers, software leadership, or anyone that would have an interest and gain benefit from running an Agile project and delivering maximum value early to your customers.</strong></p><p>No prior experience is necessary to take this course.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement.

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4391922/preview/?startPreviewId=37808260", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4374622", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Online Education", "title": "Acting course - tools of acting", "content_length": "44", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ram choudhary", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "66", "students": "12100", "coupon_code": "6FDE3A75AD580C914F4A", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4374622_e580.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-acting/?couponCode=6FDE3A75AD580C914F4A", "expired_date": "2022-10-09 19:03:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "523", "headline": "Improve your skills in acting.", "description": "<p><br></p><p>In this acting course, Ram Choudhary teach about acting (camera &amp; theater), diction, navras, characterisation, body language, dialogue delivery &amp; importance of backstories ( how to bring real-life experiences into every role and how to build your own characters).

Both of these tools utilize time value of money concepts, and we will spend a lot of time with them.</p><p>We will also discuss the payback period calculation and the modified internal rate of return or (MIRR).</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4115696/preview/?startPreviewId=34462272", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "1868702", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Accounting-Statement of Cash Flows", "content_length": "575", "level": "Intermediate Level", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "3.9", "reviews": "234", "students": "35434", "coupon_code": "1976621058157948E6D8", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1868702_a6d6_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/accounting-statement-of-cash-flows/?couponCode=1976621058157948E6D8", "expired_date": "2022-10-11 03:44:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "752", "headline": "Use the direct method and indirect method to construct the financial statement explaining how to use accounting workeet", "description": "<p>Statement of cash flows creation and analysis. </p><p>We will introduce the statement of cash flows and discuss its purpose and uses.

Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media.

Individuals often need to make similar decisions and can apply similar tools when making decisions of a large dollar amount that can affect multiple years.</strong></p><p><strong>Although the specifics of each decision differ, the concept of relevant costs helps us put together a process for gathering and analyzing data, picking up the information that matters, and removing all the excess data that does not matter to our decision. Understanding relevant costs will reduce the likelihood of making incorrect decisions based on a sunk cost effect or not taking into account opportunity costs.</strong></p><p><strong>We will analyze the decision-making process of buying a new piece of equipment or keeping an older piece of equipment, a question often relevant to individuals as well as businesses. The decision of whether to buy new equipment is subject to the sunk fallacy effect, and we will discuss why this is.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will investigate the managerial accounting question of a \u201cspecial offer.\u201d The \u201cspecial offer\u201d question often takes the form of a one time offer to purchase from us at a reduced price.

For example, a hotel may have an incentive to take a \u201cspecial offer\u201d to sleep in a room for a night at a price far below the standard rate and even below cost as it is generally calculated. We will discuss why, and how this concept applies to business in general.</strong></p><p><strong>We will apply the concepts of relevant costs to a \u201cmake or buy\u201d type decision. Should we make a component internally or purchases it from an outside vendor?</strong></p><p><strong>The course will discuss the managerial accounting question of whether we should process a product further.

We learn how to define network architecture, configure the model and train the model. Then we evaluate the performance of our trained model and use it to predict on new data. We also solve a regression problem in which we try to predict house prices in a location. We will also cover how to create complex ANN architectures using functional API. Lastly we learn how to save and restore models.</p><p>We also understand the importance of libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow in this part.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 4 - Data Preprocessing</strong></p><p>In this part you will learn what actions you need to take to prepare Data for the analysis, these steps are very important for creating a meaningful.</p><p>In this section, we will start with the basic theory of decision tree then we cover data pre-processing topics like<strong>&nbsp; </strong>missing value imputation, variable transformation and Test-Train split.</p></li><li><p><strong>Part 5 - Classic ML&nbsp;technique - Linear Regression<br></strong>This section starts with simple linear regression and then covers multiple linear regression.</p><p>We have covered the basic theory behind each concept without getting too mathematical about it so that you</p><p>understand where the concept is coming from and how it is important. But even if you don't understand</p><p>it,&nbsp; it will be okay as long as you learn how to run and interpret the result as taught in the practical lectures.</p><p>We also look at how to quantify models accuracy, what is the meaning of F statistic, how categorical variables in the independent variables dataset are interpreted in the results and how do we finally interpret the result to find out the answer to a business problem.</p></li></ul><p>By the end of this course, your confidence in creating a Neural Network model in R will soar. You'll have a thorough understanding of how to use ANN to create predictive models and solve business problems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Go ahead and click the enroll button, and I'll see you in lesson 1!</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Cheers</strong></p><p><strong>Start-Tech Academy</strong></p><p><br></p><p>------------</p><p>Below are some popular FAQs of students who want to start their Deep learning journey-</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why use R for Deep Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding R is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning. Below are some reasons why you should learn Deep learning in R</p><p>\t1. It\u2019s a popular language for Machine Learning at top tech firms. Almost all of them hire data scientists who use R. Facebook, for example, uses R to do behavioral analysis with user post data. Google uses R to assess ad effectiveness and make economic forecasts. And by the way, it\u2019s not just tech firms: R is in use at analysis and consulting firms, banks and other financial institutions, academic institutions and research labs, and pretty much everywhere else data needs analyzing and visualizing.</p><p>\t2. Learning the data science basics is arguably easier in R. R has a big advantage: it was designed specifically with data manipulation and analysis in mind. </p><p>\t3. Amazing packages that make your life easier. Because R was designed with statistical analysis in mind, it has a fantastic ecosystem of packages and other resources that are great for data science. </p><p>\t4. Robust, growing community of data scientists and statisticians. As the field of data science has exploded, R has exploded with it, becoming one of the fastest-growing languages in the world (as measured by StackOverflow). That means it\u2019s easy to find answers to questions and community guidance as you work your way through projects in R.</p><p>\t5. Put another tool in your toolkit. No one language is going to be the right tool for every job.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies. Srinidhi starts the course by explaining the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in the field of education. Slowly, he shifts to the health industry and talks about the impact of AI. We will then understand that AI in healthcare could be valuable in clinical decision support, allowing doctors to make better judgments faster by recognising patterns of health difficulties considerably more accurately than the human brain can. </p><p>After teaching this, Srinidhi moves on to further explain futuristic technologies at work that are highly powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI).&nbsp;He talks about Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Mixed Reality (MR)&nbsp;that can create the biggest impact in the field of work. </p><p>In the next following video, Srinidhi gives the most powerful predictive insights on the future of the world ruled by Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p><p>To conclude the course,&nbsp;a secretive mind-cloning AI tool is showcased.&nbsp;A mind-cloning tool like the Digital Brain concept can help you store all your thoughts, ideas and feelings via voice or text.
