The nemesis of every deathly-dull presentation on earth can be employed in fun, fascinating, and highly reader-friendly ways.</p><p>Here's how.</p><p>First, you need to learn the following five \"basic\" elements.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>5 tips for better bullet points</strong></p><p>Readers adore bullets \u2014 they make your content less difficult to skim and pull out the vital facts, so it's positively digestible.</p><p><br></p><p>But don't just toss them into your copy\u2014 use them wisely and creatively. Here are five recommendations for well-done bullets:</p><p><br></p><ol><li><p>Good bullet points raise awareness of something that <strong>satisfies the reader</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points are <strong>proportional</strong>. It's best to keep them around the exact number of lines on the screen.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points are <strong>orderly</strong>. This isn't an overview for your high school English class \u2014 bypass subsections, sub-bullets, etc.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points are <strong>parallel</strong>. Begin each bullet with the same amount of speech \u2014 if one begins with a noun, don't make the following one a verb.</p></li><li><p>Good bullet points (like headlines) <strong>aren't always whole sentences</strong> \u2026 but keep them compatible.</p></li></ol><p>And note \u2014 bullet points can be in a numbered list or in the form of \"unordered\" bullets. But both work perfectly fine.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Now for the excellent effects \u2026 fascinations.</strong></p><p>F<em>ascination is </em>an ancient copywriting word, signifying the mesmerizing elements or characteristics of a product (or service, or email newsletter, or ebook \u2026 you get the point) that can be teased out and used to draw your audience's attention to read further.</p><p>Fascinations are a particular kind of bullet point that is so exhilarating and benefit-driven that the reader just can't help but read more to discover the promised secret.</p><p><br></p><p>It's a fantastic strategy for:</p><ul><li><p>Luring readers back into the copy they skimmed</p></li><li><p>Provoking the download of a free book</p></li><li><p>Compelling someone to click on a link</p></li><li><p>Propelling subscriptions to your site or newsletter</p></li><li><p>Triggering the desired \"Add to Cart,\" click</p></li></ul><p>The key to a fascination is sagging the blessing teasingly without really giving away the \"Secret\".</p><p><br></p><p>Fascinations originate way back from traditional direct response copywriting. For instance, look at some copy from <em>Bottom Line Secrets</em>, a subscription periodical that promises insider data to make your life more comfortable. The business established itself many years ago with a sales article that was basically nothing but very captivating bullet points.</p><p>Here are some samples from that original ad:</p><ul><li><p>Why some patients are given favored status in hospitals \u2026 almost <em>preferred treatment</em>.

It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real-world data analysis in Python.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Pandas is the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis/manipulation tool available in any language</strong>.<br></p><p>pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:</p><ul><li><p>Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet</p></li><li><p>Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.</p></li><li><p>Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels</p></li><li><p>Any other form of observational / statistical data sets.

These are all instrumental building blocks when it comes to building proficiency in navigating the Lightroom workspace. Once we\u2019ve explored the foundations, we transition over to exploring the map module. Here we explore navigating the map module, with an overview of its use cases. From there we dive into geotagging both single photos and collection sets. Students also learn to filter images by location and use saved locations for enhanced sorting and tagging.<br><br>After completion of the map module, we transition to the book module. Here students will learn to create stunning, customized photo books using their image collections. We start with demonstrating how to navigate the book module interface. From there we explore book settings and layout options. This includes customized pages, page numbers, cell padding, and text formatting. We also cover background effects, before concluding with book publication using both third party services, or simply saving as PDF or JPEG files.<br><br>As you can see this course covers a number of topics that are essential to anyone starting off with Lightroom. It\u2019s also a great resource for both professional and aspiring photographers that are looking to take their existing photos to the next level.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for <strong>computer forensics</strong> but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.</p><p>Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (ediscovery) may be involved</p><p>During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.</p><p>Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4372164/preview/?startPreviewId=38948904", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4651160", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Marketing Analytics & Automation", "title": "Grow your business with Chatbot Marketing!", "content_length": "148", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Anton Voroniuk", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "46", "students": "17848", "coupon_code": "CHATBOT0512", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4651160_5b0e_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/chatbot-marketing-course/?couponCode=CHATBOT0512", "expired_date": "2022-12-09 07:10:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "134", "headline": "Hands-on guide to Chatbot Marketing for beginners.

As the project manager role now goes beyond basic implementation of the project plan, they also need good customer relations and business skills in addition to their traditional capabilities.</p><p>In this master course you will learn the 5 Major topics:</p><p>1.

Whereas outbound marketing was formerly the sole option, inbound marketing's development and resounding success have opened up a slew of new marketing strategies and techniques. These new tools are not only beneficial to know, but also crucial to grasp if your company wants to thrive in this increasingly digital world.&nbsp;Let's talk about the importance of video marketing and advertising. </p><p>The relevance of video marketing has grown to the point where leaving it out of your content marketing strategy is no longer an option. Investing in video marketing is a must if you want to provide content that today's viewers are yearning for.</p><p>Audiences desire material that meets their needs, and with people's attention spans dwindling as a result of their busy lives, providing video content is becoming increasingly essential. It's a visual-based, often compact medium that can be absorbed fast and easily shared. Because video streaming and output can be utilised on all of the major social media sources without requiring a large budget or substantial video production experience, this is a versatile and core weapon for marketers. It's a simple, laid-back video marketing strategy that effectively creates rapport with your audience as they progress through the sales funnel.</p><p>As an inbound marketer, you should always be looking for material that your target audience would find beneficial. While video-based content isn't for everyone, it has such a big audience that integrating it into your marketing will only broaden the ways your audience may interact with your company and its content.</p><p><strong>Video marketing</strong> refers to the use of videos to promote and inform people about a product or service. It boosts engagement on your digital and social channels, educates your audience, and gives you a new way to reach out to them. Videos help you build authority and give your message a more personal feel. If you employ video instead of another sort of material, you will be much more likely to connect with your audience on an emotional level. The attention of an audience is immediately captured by videos. A video might sometimes be just what a presentation needs to \"wake up\" the audience and get them to pay attention to what the presenter has to say. Videos are appealing to students of all ages and learning styles. Videos are shown to people at all levels of education.</p><p>Did you know?&nbsp;By catching attention and driving demand at scale, <strong>video advertising</strong> may help you increase brand awareness to the core. Most importantly, you can reach out to potential consumers on YouTube when they're watching or searching for videos. </p><p><strong>YouTube Video commercials </strong>that bring rise to users' curiosity and then follow up with a compelling final call-to-action are sure to keep everyone interested.</p><p>According to studies, the average user remembers 95% of a message when it is viewed versus 10% when it is read. This indicates that prospects are more likely to remember your message through a video advertisement than from an image or text advertisement. Furthermore, a positive video ad experience enhances a user's buy intent by 98 percent and brand association by 149 percent.</p><p>You can specify what action you want viewers to perform with video adverts, such as:</p><ul><li><p>People visiting your website to check your items and learn more about your brand</p></li><li><p>Increasing the number of videos you watch on your YouTube channel in order to expand your audience and boost brand awareness</p></li></ul><p>Users are drawn to video ads because they combine two things that attract their attention: movement and sound. Both of these factors contribute to an effective message and, as a result, increased engagement.</p><p>If you're ever wondering about how you can create effective video advertising campaigns to take your video marketing to the next level - you can look no further than taking this course! This mind-blowing online course talks also about some amazing video marketing, keyword research and internet trend finder tools that will prove to be really helpful for video marketers like you. What's more?&nbsp;This course will also contain the Google Ads dashboard walkthrough taught by Srinidhi and video advertising campaign creation steps along with the report-seeking process.</p><p>It's time to become a Professional YouTube Advertising Expert in the fastest time possible ever!</p><p>Lights!&nbsp;Camera!&nbsp;Action!</p><p>Enroll now and let's start the magic.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4549894/preview/?startPreviewId=39456050", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4982733", "category": "IT & Software", "sub_category": "IT Certifications", "title": "LPI Linux Essentials 010-160 Certification Exam Practice", "content_length": "0", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Kirill Johnson", "rating": "4.4", "reviews": "16", "students": "4476", "coupon_code": "40CA7B67342DADC6C940", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4982733_9a43.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/lpi-linux-essentials-010-160-exam-questions/?couponCode=40CA7B67342DADC6C940", "expired_date": "2022-12-11 16:02:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "423", "headline": "Want to pass LPI 010-160 exam?

This is remarkably factual when selling books \u2014 like Boardroom and Rodale do via the mail. And like many Internet marketers accomplish online.</p><p><br></p><p>Every great A-list writer has acquired the capacity to compose world-class bullets, and it's UNUSUAL to see a large package without at least 10 to 20, if not even more.</p><p><br></p><p>Plus, it's problematic not to cherish them \u2014 these tiny benefit-packed JEWELS do so much in such a small space!</p><p><br></p><p>Nine times out of TEN, bullets and fascinations propose blessings \u2026 but GREAT ones do considerably better than that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The best bullets and fascinations often accomplish the following:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>Enormously inspire curiosity and intrigue \u2026</p></li><li><p>Entice your ideal customer to read, read, READ!</p></li><li><p>Create desire \u2014 step by step \u2014 by creating the desire to \"learn\" the mystery your bullet swears to disclose \u2026</p></li><li><p>Grab your prospect's attention and maintain him zooming on the copy \u2026</p></li><li><p>Make your sales message easily readable (which consistently increases response!) \u2026</p></li><li><p>Pump up your publicity with a mixture and stop the disastrous \"flat\" benefit syndrome \u2026</p></li><li><p>Crush \"headline block,\" immediately offering a fortune of fantastic headline options \u2026</p></li><li><p>And many, many more!.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>How to write GREAT bullets that make it Inconceivable for your copy to be ignored</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Writing excellent bullets and fascinations is really a science. It's about carrying all the suitable instruments and creating a little powerhouse of desire.</p><p><br></p><p>Suppose you're writing bullets for a fascinations book or a premium brochure. In that circumstance, you'll typically begin by examining the daylights out of your topic.</p><p><br></p><p>Legends like the bright direct response marketer \"<strong>Gene Schwartz</strong>\" would start reading a book numerous times, emphasizing key points and tidbits with each read. Then he'd ask his secretary or a typist to organize his notes (which would frequently add up to a 70-page manuscript!) Eventually, he'd organize the bullets and commence filling in the running text, completing the fascinations as they came to him.</p><p><br></p><p>Others have a negligibly different approach. Clayton's exemplary mate and seven-figure direct response writer, Parris Lampropoulos, start by scanning through his analysis and writing as many as 800 fascinations. Talk about discipline! He'll likely only maintain about 100 of them at the most. Still, Parris likes to have approximately eight times more than he could ever utilize.</p><p><br></p><p>This is an elite system because it ensures that every bullet or desire that makes it into the final draft is impressive. He selects precisely from the \"cream of the crop\" rather than some useful ones and a ton of tolerable ones. (I'm sure you've noticed this issue \u2014 specifically online \u2014 where you're reading a long line of bullets, and 3 out of 4 are passable, at best. You can gamble that the writer didn't note seven times what he required and then pick his best!)</p><p><br></p><p>Looking at Parris's writings, I witness how this offers him many mixtures in his bullet sections, making them more fascinating and satisfying to read. This is paramount\u2014 especially in promotions implicating many fascinations \u2014 because even just one or two imperfect ones can cause your reader to begin \"skimming.\" Occasionally, a few horrible bullets can get your copy dumped!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Remember, \"your NUMBER One MISSION as a direct response MARKETER is to keep your Ideal CUSTOMER READING!</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As you know, the essential purpose of copywriting is to CONVERT A CUSTOMER TO MAKE THE SALE. And, without question, the most reasonable way to do so is to keep your Ideal customer reading.</p><p><br></p><p>Have you ever witnessed when you're reading sales copy\u2026 if you read or research a good one from beginning to end\u2026 Do you start sensing that you DESIRE the product? That's the enchantment of a long copy! But it ONLY functions if you MAINTAIN your prospect's interest and curiosity to the end.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why Clayton frequently debates systematically about weeding out \"ineffective associations\" in your text\u2014 because weak connections push you to lose the reader's attention. And eventually, cause you to lose sales. Because they're so comfortable to read, bullets can be the most harmful of weak links.</p><p><br></p><p>That's why, if you bore your ideal customer with impotent or redundant bullets, the best-case strategy is that he begins flipping and scanning (the contrary to what you desire). This is one step from placing the letter down or tossing it in the garbage.</p><p><br></p><p>So you want to create and change your bullets, so your copy has a natural flow and doesn't seem fake. This signifies that some bullets need to be long, others short, some bullets blind, and others where you disclose the complete secret your ideal customer can directly benefit from.</p><p><br></p><p>Reading bullets should provide your prospect with a thrilling sensation. Almost like he's on a roller coaster adventure and doesn't predict which way he's going to be turned next.</p><p><br></p><p>If you can keep your prospect reading through a long string of high-quality bullets and fascinations, your possibilities of making the sale rise exponentially!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How to CRUSH \"headline block\" for REAL</strong></p><p><br></p><p>And here's another compelling benefit you'll obtain when you become a terrific bullet and fascination writer. Having an army of killer bullets and fascinations in your possession gives you a slew of outstanding headline opinions and opportunities.</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the finest writers in the industry will often begin their writing approach with bullets and fascinations.</p><p><br></p><p>That way, when it's time to compose the headline, you've got dozens \u2026 if not HUNDREDS of great potential options for an incredible headline.</p><p><br></p><p>One of the more current models of a winning headline that started as a bullet is from the control for Bottom Line Personal: \"<strong>How Doctors Stay Well While Treating Sick People All Day.\"</strong></p><p><br></p><p>This was simply the most fascinating, benefit-based bullet out of hundreds reported by the package's author. If you see, it also indicates \"<strong>credibility</strong>\" because it mentions doctors. (We'll examine the demand for evidence and credibility in your bullets more in a moment.</p><p><br></p><p>To work the same magic in your script, just write LOTS of bullets concealing every shocking, captivating, and emotionally touching amount of data you hold. When you've finished, you'll have at least a few awesome headlines \u2014 presumably at least 1-2 GREAT ones!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4773334/preview/?startPreviewId=42385422", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2468316", "category": "Business", "sub_category": "Real Estate", "title": "Facebook Ads Copywriting & Facebook Ads for Real Estate 2023", "content_length": "936", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ing.

No wonder: it can process data on an enormous scale, supports multiple coding languages (you can use Java, Scala, Python, R, and SQL) and runs on its own or in the cloud, as well as on other systems (e.g., Hadoop or Kubernetes).</p><p>In this Apache Spark tutorial, I will introduce you to one of the most notable use cases of Apache Spark: machine learning. In less than two hours, we will go through every step of a machine learning project that will provide us with an accurate telecom customer churn prediction in the end. This is going to be a fully hands-on experience, so roll up your sleeves and prepare to give it your best!</p><p><strong>First and foremost, how does Apache Spark machine learning work?</strong></p><p>Before you learn Apache Spark, you need to know it comes with a few inbuilt libraries. One of them is called MLlib. To put it simply, it allows the Spark Core to perform machine learning tasks \u2013 and (as you will see in this Apache Spark tutorial) does it in breathtaking speed. Due to its ability to handle significant amounts of data, Apache Spark is perfect for tasks related to machine learning, as it can ensure more accurate results when training algorithms.</p><p>Mastering Apache Spark machine learning can also be a skill highly sought after by employers and headhunters: more and more companies get interested in applying machine learning solutions for business analytics, security, or customer service. Hence, this practical Apache Spark tutorial can become your first step towards a lucrative career!</p><p><strong>Learn Apache Spark by creating a project from A to Z yourself!</strong></p><p>I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t included any purely theoretical lectures in this Apache Spark tutorial: you will learn everything on the way and be able to put it into practice straight away. Seeing the way each feature works will help you learn Apache Spark machine learning thoroughly by heart.</p><p>I will also be providing some materials in ZIP archives. Make sure to download them at the beginning of the course, as you will not be able to continue with the project without it.</p><p><strong>And that\u2019s not all you\u2019re getting from this course \u2013 can you believe it?</strong></p><p>Apart from Spark itself, I will also introduce you to Databricks \u2013 a platform that simplifies handling and organizing data for Spark. It\u2019s been founded by the same team that initially started Spark, too. In this course, I will explain how to create an account on Databricks and use its Notebook feature for writing and organizing your code.</p><p>After you finish my Apache Spark tutorial, you will have a fully functioning telecom customer churn prediction project.

The course will show how to calculate the predetermined overhead rate and how to use this rate to estimate overhead allocated to departments.</p><p>The course will record the journal entries related to costs as they flow through the process cost system including journal entries for the transfer of raw materials to work in process and factory overhead, the incurrence of direct and indirect wages, and other overhead costs.

I found this course created by TJ Walker a perfect introduction to the world of media training. I wanted to learn, not only what a media trainer does, but also what steps I would have to take in order to become a successful media trainer--TJ discusses all this in a clear and concise manner, in a tone that is welcoming and never alienating. The only constructive critique I would give would be concerning the technical form of the presentation, more specifically the video quality and picture aesthetic. Going by the current standard as it applies to video, everything we view is in high definition. Having said that, I believe the video quality could be improved upon as well as the backdrop which I found to be a bit generic and outdated. I found these minor flaws to be slightly distracting and given the high caliber of the speaker and the information being presented I believe these aspects detracted, if only marginally, from the quality of the product.\"&nbsp;</em>Nick Cisik</p><p><em>\"5 Stars!

Frustration that no one seems to be able to do what they\u2019re teaching when it comes to speaking and communication. Everyone is either trying to teach you how to be a motivational speaker or some BS on overcoming your fears. In other words, it\u2019s all self-help. But what does facing your fears and embracing your passion have to do with your regional sales report? Or a meeting with five people? Or doing a quarterly update for your company? Or a presentation in University? Nothing!</p><p>Let's be very honest.&nbsp; If you have ever taken a public speaking course, chances are you\u2019ve been bored through most of it and it probably didn't change anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;This course will introduce a completely different way to learn communication skills and public speaking.&nbsp; We are not going to talk about ideas that sound great, but do nothing to change behaviour, we are going to introduce physical tactics you can practice and apply instantly.</p><p><strong>By the end of this course you will be able to:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Create opening and closing statements in a way that will activate the brain.</p></li><li><p>Design problem and solution statements that engage the imagination</p></li><li><p>Apply a strategy to effectively transition between ideas</p></li><li><p>Use a series of physical tactics to communicate confidence irrespective of how you feel</p></li><li><p>Identify a new way to practice speaking and deal with nervousness</p></li></ul><p>Most people who teach public speaking were in sales or marketing their whole lives, but those are specific fields, and they don\u2019t provide examples from outside of their fields or their personal experiences. Also, just because they did it for years, doesn\u2019t mean they are any good at it. So, in essence, there are two big problems with the current state of public speaking education and training.</p><p>1. None of it is practical or applies to most of our day-to-day needs</p><p>2.

I spoke to stand-up comics, buskers, and professional wrestlers because, if you think about it, these are people who can actually get crowds around them, make them feel something, get them excited, and make them stop what they\u2019re doing and pay attention.</p><p><strong>REAL EXPERTS:</strong> I spoke to police interrogators and professional poker players, and I asked them\u2026 how do you know when someone is lying?
