If you're willing to learn and apply the knowledge I share with you,<em> I</em> can teach you the rest.</p><p><strong>Okay, I'm Interested, So What Will I Learn Exactly?</strong></p><p>First, you\u2019ll get a comprehensive, high quality video overview that will show you how to create facebook ads that deliver real results. I\u2019ll show you step by step, <em>every</em> stage of setting up and running successful ad campaigns on Facebook, from <em>start to finish. </em>You\u2019ll learn how to create your very first Facebook business page and set up the Facebook catalog. This is important, so you can automate your marketing across different e-commerce channels in the Facebook Audience Network.</p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the process of creating and setting up an Ads Manager account and I\u2019ll show you how to correctly navigate Facebook Ads Manager. I\u2019ll walk you through setting up your payment information, ad budget, and ad expenditure limits. <em>Then</em> I\u2019ll take you step-by-step through the architecture of a Winning Facebook Ad Campaign, so you can see what you need to do and why. I\u2019ll also show you how to set up and use Facebook Business Manager correctly, so you can efficiently organise and manage your Facebook Ad accounts and Pages.</p><p><strong>Select The Right Ad To Achieve Your Marketing Goals</strong></p><p>You\u2019ll learn the different types of Facebook Ads, when you should use them, and the different marketing goals the various types of ads Facebook offers. We\u2019ll be particularly focusing on the top two ways to sell on Facebook \u2013 Facebook Dynamic Ads and Facebook Conversion Ads.</p><p><strong>Dynamic Ads</strong></p><p>Here you can watch as I show you how to get more from your website traffic and teach you how to activate people\u2019s needs, wants, and pain points, using highly relevant, engaging ads. Dynamic Ads help you target or re-target people who have already browsed or purchased on your website. With these Ads, Facebook automatically shows the right products to the right audience, based on people\u2019s online interests and previous purchasing and browsing behaviour.</p><p><strong>Conversion Ads</strong></p><p>Conversion Ads require the Facebook Pixel to be set up correctly on your website, which I\u2019ll show you how to do in this course. They differ from lead generation Ads because the goal here is to direct people away from social media, to your ecommerce website, where they convert, i.e. make that purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Carousel For Ecommerce</strong></p><p>Watch me as I show you how to set up your first Facebook carousel ad for ecommerce. I\u2019ll be demonstrating how you can use the carousel format to display up to ten product images or videos in <em>one single ad</em>, and how each image or video can have its own link too.</p><p>Carousel Ads are great if you want more space to highlight several products, showcase different product features, or give details about a promotion. They are also a great way to tell your brand story, as you can develop a narrative across each carousel card.</p><p><strong>Set Up Your First Facebook Catalog</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take you through the <em>exact</em> process you need to follow to correctly SET UP YOUR FIRST FACEBOOK CATALOG. Once you\u2019ve done this, you can add new products easily, and will be able to advertise all your items across multiple channels.</p><p>The Facebook catalog works by storing data you\u2019ve entered about the products you want to advertise on the Facebook network. You can connect your catalog to different Facebook platforms to display your products to potential customers, including Instagram, the Facebook Dynamic Ad network, Facebook Page Shops, and more.</p><p><strong>Discover The Customer Journey To Purchase</strong></p><p>The customer journey is a CRITICAL part of the selling process, and I'll be covering the three crucial stages of this process inside. I'll demonstrate how you can use Dynamic and Conversion Ads, to gain your audiences trust and encourage them to purchase.</p><p><strong>Find Your Ideal Customer</strong></p><p>We\u2019ll also look at how to target your ads correctly, so you get maximum results from your ad spend.</p><p>You\u2019ll be able to watch as I demonstrate you how to use Breakdowns to hone in on your perfect customer. I\u2019ll demonstrate how to use targeting and retargeting to attract potential customers who have already expressed an interest in your product, or in a similar product. I\u2019ll also show you how to reel customers in who have already visited your website or interacted with your content.</p><p>You\u2019ll learn how you can use lookalike and custom audiences to reach a wider audience of suitable customers, who will be primed for what you\u2019re offering. You\u2019ll discover the exact steps needed to create custom audiences, and you\u2019ll understand how to create Lookalike Audiences you can advertise to on Facebook and on Instagram.</p><p>As well as this, we\u2019ll be using the Audience Insight Tool to help you gain more understanding of your target market. Using this tool will help you to strategize ways to connect with your perfect customer.</p><p><strong>Getting The Most Out Of The Facebook Pixel And Facebook Pixel Events</strong></p><p>Watch as I show you how to correctly set up and use Facebook Pixel Events, so you can target and retarget better, and catch more interested potential customers.</p><p>Setting up the Facebook Pixel and using Facebook Pixel Events are two things many people fail to do correctly. Yet they\u2019re so vital for boosting the results you get from Facebook Ads. With my help you'll be able to carry out a complete set up and install, easily, and fast.</p><p>I\u2019ll also be demonstrating how to install the Facebook Pixel on Shopify, so you can use that platform to expand your market reach. And you\u2019ll learn how to use Facebook Pixel Events to understand and respond to your customer\u2019s path to purchase.</p><p><strong>Facebook Pixel Events To Take Your Ad Game To The Next Level</strong></p><p>This is a crucial step that will take your sales from flabby to fabulous, as it allows you to tailor your marketing precisely. With it you'll maximise your chances of getting the desired response you want from potential customers.</p><p>With Facebook Pixel Events you can automatically create Custom Audiences based on actions people take in your app or on your website. You can then target them with relevant ads whenever they visit Facebook, Instagram, or websites in the Facebook Audience Network. You can also use Facebook Pixel Events to create highly targeted Lookalike audiences, based on actions visitors take on your website or in your app.</p><p>I\u2019ll be showing you how to use Facebook Pixel Events to get more from your Facebook Ad budget, by greatly expanding your customer reach and selling power.</p><p><strong>Convert More, Sell Faster</strong></p><p>You'll receive my exclusive techniques for maximising your ad conversion rate on facebook. Conversions are hard to get but there are some pro-level tricks that can help you quickly boost your percentages. I'll be sharing what these are, and how you can easily implement them in my course.</p><p><strong>Create Compelling Ad Copy That Sells</strong></p><p>You'll also get a comprehensive quick start to copywriting master, so you can create copy that engages right off the bat.

Especially for independent films. Let me say the way it is, your movie poster is the deciding factor for the audience when deciding what to watch. As simple as that. It's beyond important. Imagine getting home from work, getting comfortable on a sofa in front of your tv, and scrolling through hundreds of tv shows and movies deciding what to watch. </p><p>Subconsciously you will choose something that stands out from other films, and you will judge it by the poster. With years of making indie films and doing everything myself, I learned why my movies are not getting enough attention. That is not because of how good or how bad the movie is, sure it's important but it's not a deciding factor. In this course, you will learn how to design a great-looking film poster for a film that grabs attention and stands out among others. </p><p>We will go through everything from doing research, finding suitable images for your poster, putting it all together, and much more.

The premise of CBT is that cognition (thoughts and beliefs) can influence feelings and behavior. CBT attempts to modify thoughts and beliefs about experiences, which in turn determine feelings and behaviors. By completing this training series you learn the skills and practice the techniques required to provide effective CBT to the people you serve.</p><p>Upon completion of this training, participants will be able to: Accurately assess if CBT is a relevant/indicated intervention, Conceptualize a case from a CBT framework, Demonstrate appropriate application of introductory CBT techniques, Address common stumbling blocks/challenges \uf0b7 Tailor interactions to meet the needs of the person receiving services where they are \uf0b7 Incorporate recovery and culture into treatment plans</p><p>CBT is based on the idea that the way we think about situations can affect the way we feel and behave. For example, if you interpret a situation negatively then you might experience negative emotions as a result, and those bad feelings might then lead you to behave in a certain way.</p><p>In CBT you work with a therapist to identify and challenge any negative thinking patterns and behaviour which may be causing you difficulties. In turn this can change the way you feel about situations, and enable you to change your behaviour in future. You and your therapist might focus on what is going on in your life right now, but you might also look at your past, and think about how your past experiences impact the way you see the world.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4455060/preview/?startPreviewId=38379168", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3873634", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Money Management Tools", "title": "QuickBooks Online Multiple Currencies", "content_length": "536", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "48", "students": "17337", "coupon_code": "0810340CCAB20645305C", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3873634_359a.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-online-multiple-currencies/?couponCode=0810340CCAB20645305C", "expired_date": "2022-09-13 01:39:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "853", "headline": "Learn to record transactions using multiple currencies from a certified public accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>Learn how to get access to QuickBooks Online including a possible free 30-day trial version often offered by Intuit, the owner of QuickBooks Online.</p><p>The course will discuss accounting for multiple currencies, outlining the process in Excel to provide a more transparent look at the process.

It can be really disheartening and even disappointing at times, especially if you keep applying and receiving fewer or no responses. Job hunting is a difficult and time-consuming procedure whatsoever. But, wait, automation technology might have a solution after all. <strong><em>Automation</em></strong> can definitely increase productivity, improve efficiency, reduce time and effort.&nbsp;In most cases, the automation tools learn themselves from the mistakes that occurred in the past and reduce the future chance of errors happening. </p><p>This mind-blowing course created by&nbsp;<strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" </strong>and <strong>\"First Look Digital Marketing Solutions\"</strong> is going to change the facet of technology to bring forth a revolution in the job-search and application process using the power of the LazyApply platform. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;You will save 100's of hours of time by automating the job-search/application process A-Z as you learn and master the automation procedure of applying to jobs on LinkedIn and Indeed. You will realize that you are learning about a Smart AI that automatically fills the job applications based on the information provided.

These and other cognitive functions are performed by the vastly interconnected neural networks formed by the roughly 100 billion neurons of the brain. The precise patterns of connectivity among neurons within these networks determines their function, and through experience, these connectivity patterns change over time to enable acquisition of new skills. Indeed, one of the most impressive aspects of brain function is the ability to learn new cognitive skills, such as the ability to understand and speak a foreign language. During learning, connections between neurons change through a process known as synaptic plasticity, which plays a pivotal role in learning, While traditional learning brings about changes in neural networks through experience, synaptic plasticity can also be enhanced by activating neuromodulatory regions in the brain via peripheral neurostimulation. This program seeks to use peripheral neurostimulation to facilitate the release of neurotransmitters associated with components of learning, such as acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. By combining peripheral neurostimulation with conventional training practices, we can leverage endogenous neuronal circuitry to enhance learning by accelerating the tuning of neural networks responsible for cognitive functions.</p><p>Recent success with this approach has been demonstrated in clinical rehabilitation studies, utilizing peripheral neurostimulation delivered through implanted electrodes. However, while invasive approaches may be justified for treating people with medical conditions, noninvasive methods are preferred for use in healthy individuals</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4456054/preview/?startPreviewId=38425608", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3819046", "category": "Teaching & Academics", "sub_category": "Engineering", "title": "Fundamental Question on Deep Learning", "content_length": "0", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Harish Kumar Maheshwari", "rating": "4.0", "reviews": "24", "students": "17881", "coupon_code": "00BD6D8A8A32F1CE20A6", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3819046_02c7_3.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-deep-learning/?couponCode=00BD6D8A8A32F1CE20A6", "expired_date": "2022-09-11 10:30:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "532", "headline": "Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) on Deep Learning", "description": "<p><strong>Preparing for Interview in Deep Learning?

Putting aside the excitement of new developments, the convenience that technology may provide is unrivalled. Long before the pandemic, the mix of fitness technology and digital fitness was altering our market; both areas were rising at a rapid pace. This transition affects both consumers (gym goers) and suppliers (gyms/personal trainers) now more than ever before. Fitness businesses and members alike have invested in home new-age fitness equipment - and the fitness industry has shifted online to survive: gyms have improved their online offerings, and members have improved their home set-ups, investing in a variety of equipment, apps, wearables, and fitness trackers for the long-term. The use of social media in gym marketing has become a must. It's a channel via which people can quickly obtain information. They can provide gym-specific advice or information, thereby educating followers on health and wellness and boosting the active-living trend. Owners are rewarded with useful comments, allowing them to establish a solid business reputation, increase member trust, and attract new potential consumers by mentioning their brand online. People are too communicating with each other online in greater numbers than ever before. They follow an influencer on Instagram, subscribe to a fitness channel on YouTube, join a fitness group on Facebook, and like a friend's Instagram post about weight reduction success. Gyms are starting to recognise the social component of fitness by making it look that fitness is less about attending the gym and more about living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>The fitness industry has had to conform to a new normal; future gyms will be hybrid and virtual reality, and gym members will track their progress and exercise both in and out of the gym even digitally!! The health and fitness tech business is greatly growing at a breakneck pace, thanks to advances in wearable technology, artificial intelligence, and even mixed reality, making it an exciting time for both customers and developers.</p><p>Oculus stealthily released a fitness tracker called Oculus Move that sits inside its Quest headsets in the final days of 2020. Users who download the software can climb on a ticker hovering above or below their field of view to see how many calories they burn in virtual reality, as well as how many minutes they spend physically active. They can also create goals and track their progress over time by digging deeper into the tracker's dashboard. There are plenty of virtual reality programmes nowadays too, you can use to burn calories, but just a few are exclusively focused on exercise right now.</p><p>Apps for fitness have never been more important. Fitness app downloads are bound to increase by about 50% in the first half of 2022, according to the World Economic Forum. It's a big increase, demonstrating how popular home fitness has become, with hundreds of subscription-based options now accessible. One standout brand has been setting the pace and capitalising on consumer demand called 360 Wellness.&nbsp;360 Wellness is a decentralised and unique live wellness marketplace concept. It's really a robust set of web and mobile applications that connect individuals with health and fitness specialists all over the world. </p><p>Let's now look at what kind of incredible stuff you will be learning in this course titled <strong>\"New-Age Technologies For Fitness Trainers (2022 Edition)\" </strong>that has been created by<strong><em>&nbsp;\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and \"Piyush\".</em></strong></p><p>We will learn that technological advancements continue to have an enormous impact on practically every aspect of our life. People's communication, information seeking, music listening, meal ordering, and shopping habits have all changed as a result of them. We will also discover how technology is creating a huge impact on the fitness businesses and professionals, with even gyms changing how they deliver workout routines. What's more?&nbsp;We will be learning about wearable tech, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;on the fitness industry and unveiling the future of fitness training using the 360 Wellness App. A topic lesson on 3D&nbsp;sports prototypes will ultimately amaze you to the core.

It was designed to be quick, practical and goal-oriented and to provide people with long-term skills to keep them healthy. The focus of cbt is on the problems that come up in a person\u2019s day-to-day life. cbt helps people to look at how they interpret and evaluate what is happening around them and the effects these perceptions have on their emotional experience.</p><p>Childhood experiences and events, while not the focus of cbt, may also be reviewed. This review can help people to understand and address emotional upset that emerged early in life, and to learn how these experiences may influence current responses to events</p><p>According to cbt, the way people feel is linked to the way they think about a situation and not simply to the nature of the situation itself</p><p>In cbt, you learn to identify, question and change the thoughts, attitudes, beliefs and assumptions related to your problematic emotional and behavioural reactions to certain kinds of situations.</p><p>By monitoring and recording your thoughts during situations that lead to emotional upset, you learn that the way you think can contribute to emotional problems such as depression and anxiety. In cbt, you learn to reduce these emotional problems by: \u2022 identifying distortions in your thinking \u2022 seeing thoughts as ideas about what is going on rather than as facts \u2022 \u201cstanding back\u201d from your thinking to consider situations from different viewpoints</p><p>For cbt to be effective, you must be open and willing to discuss your thoughts, beliefs and behaviours and to participate in exercises during sessions. For best results, you must also be willing to do homework between sessions.</p><p>CBT is an effective treatment for many psychological conditions. These include: \u2022 mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder \u2022 anxiety disorders, including specific phobias (fear of animals, heights, enclosed spaces), panic disorder, social phobia (social anxiety disorder), generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder \u2022 bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder \u2022 body dysmorphic disorder (body image) \u2022 substance use disorders ( smoking, alcohol and other drugs).</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4456050/preview/?startPreviewId=38492586", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4164832", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Finance", "title": "Corp Finance #17 Merger, Acquisition & Foreign Currency", "content_length": "445", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.7", "reviews": "17", "students": "14628", "coupon_code": "D5701B1C4AF8A1C67B81", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4164832_9281.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/corp-finance-17-merger-acquisition-foreign-currency/?couponCode=D5701B1C4AF8A1C67B81", "expired_date": "2022-09-13 01:28:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "708", "headline": "Learn about mergers, acquisitions, & foreign currency transactions from a certified public accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will cover mergers, acquisitions &amp; foreign currency.</p><p>We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems.

The rapid speed of AI growth demonstrates that it is a groundbreaking technology designed to transform the way people use devices and conduct business: achievements in unmanned aerial vehicles, the ability to beat people in chess and sporting games, automated customer service, and analytical systems - of course. Talking about the business, development, or marketing field, for instance, it is worth noting that Artificial Intelligence does not apply in a pure form to real self-aware intelligence machines in this sense. Instead, it can be considered a generic term for the number of software powered by automation that is being used by developers of websites and smartphone apps. They include the recognition of images and speech, cognitive computing, automated processing, and machine learning - for that matter. </p><p>Speaking of AI&nbsp;in app creation, for many years, starting with Apple's Siri, AI has already been influential in app-creation and marketing growth. It has the ability to advance even further in the coming years. Retail giants such as eBay and Amazon have already shown the ability for AI mobile applications to thrive. With new developments in technology and evolving customer expectations, the production of AI-powered mobile apps is the new digital frontier for businesses.</p><p>Further speaking, the extension of AI technology has allowed mobile users to reposition the current user experience value benchmark - altogether. Users are beginning to demand more in-depth and customized mobile app results. The output that a typical Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;based app creation tool can deliver is certainly remarkable and holistic.</p><p>This course is a beginner's course that is focused on <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in App Creation</strong>. It has been created by Digital Marketing Legend \"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\" and Mastermind \"Saranya Srinidhi\". We will look at a theoretical and practical approach to the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;in the field of app creation and development.

The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.</p><p>The general idea we want to keep in our mind is that businesses are looking to invest assets in order to receive a return. Capital, or financing, is needed for the capital investments. A company could generate the capital from internal operations, but often looks for other sources of financing to facilitate faster growth and quicker revenue generation.</p><p>The options to acquire capital include debt financing and equity financing. As a company thinks about their financing options, they should have an understanding of their financing structure. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is often used for financing decisions. This course will demonstrate the WACC calculation.</p><p>Learners will understand how to calculate the cost of debt. One of the primary forms of debt financing are corporate bonds, the cost including interest payments on the bonds. Taxes have a big impact on financing decisions. Bond interest is generally tax deductible.</p><p>We will also consider preferred stock financing. In many ways preferred stock is similar to debt financing because of the payments that are somewhat standardized. However, preferred stock does not have a maturity date and the payments are not generally tax deductible.</p><p>The course will demonstrate common stock financing, a form of equity financing. It can be more difficult to value the cost of common stock financing and we will consider methods in doing so.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4115694/preview/?startPreviewId=34438306", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4431152", "category": "Marketing", "sub_category": "Video & Mobile Marketing", "title": "YouTube Marketing, YouTube Ranking & Adobe Premier Pro Guide", "content_length": "717", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Ing.

Many people lost their jobs during the pandemic, so now is the ideal time to create a business online and generate income by self-publishing low content books on Amazon KDP (kindle direct publishing)!</p><p><br></p><p>In late 2021, I started my <strong>Amazon KDP</strong> business, and I could see the tremendous opportunity of this business. <strong><em>Fast Forward</em></strong> 6 Months, and I've now sold over <strong>10000 </strong>Low Content Books on Amazon KDP, generating a passive income of over $1600 per month.</p><p><br></p><p>The low content Books that I published in the first few months of 2021 still bring me a daily income that ranges from $10 to 50 dollars a day.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part about self-publishing low content books on amazon is that I haven't modified these books for nearly 6 months now! These low-content paperback books will continue generating passive income in future years!</p><p><br></p><p>I started my pro career as an industrial engineer. But I always kept my dream of creating and conducting my own online business.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me many years to discover exactly what it was. At this moment, I couldn't be more satisfied working online from any area around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I can gladly say that I'm doing what I am devoted to. The favorable effect you can have by designing and publishing gift books, teaching resources, daily journals, etc., is a great way to be inspired each day you publish on Amazon KDP.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Self publishing on Amazon KDP is a profitable business model</strong>?</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, there is no obstacle to launching an amazon KDP business. You can basically create low content books for <em>free; setting</em> up an amazon kindle account, book covers, and book interiors requires no experience.</p><p><br></p><p>I am an industrial engineer with no fancy photoshop or canva design skills, so rest assured that you don't need to have a pre-requisite to start your business on KDP!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>KDP Low or even no Content Books</strong> are <em>Fast and fun </em>to create. Amazon does all the heavy lifting for you, from Printing the book to Distribution, Customer support, and Processing payments and refunds.</p><p><br></p><p>As the author and publisher of low-content books, you receive a royalty payment from amazon as soon as your book sells on the KDP platform.</p><p><br></p><p>You no longer have to pile stacks of pre-printed books, expecting any future sales. Amazon KDP is a Print on Demand business model (POD).</p><p><br></p><p>Your low content book will only be printed and distributed by Amazon once a customer orders from Amazon through their online platform. As soon as the customer orders the book, Amazon takes care of all the rest for you!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should I choose KDP Publishing over other online alternatives?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Self-publishing on Amazon KDP is one of the few online business models that require no budget (You can start with a zero-dollar budget).</p><p><br></p><p>The advantage of KDP is that \"Amazon\" the world's largest distributor of books, takes care of everything for you.</p><p><br></p><p>You also have total control over the design and book settings before you decide to publish, and without needing outside experts to outsource design and publishing skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Same as with print on demand, Amazon takes excellent care of handling customer service for you. This is why starting a KDP business is the perfect passive income money-generating asset.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Choose This Course?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Start Your KDP Journey Now! </strong>I was able to turn my online KDP publishing business into a highly profitable business in lesser than a year. With the sharp rise in online shopping, there is no better time than <strong><em>NOW</em></strong> to launch your <strong>KDP Publishing</strong> online business, and to start earning long-term passive income.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You can start with a zero-dollar budget</strong>. I started with ZERO $, and I will share how you can do the same during the course.</p><p> If you have around $10, you can get started even quicker.

We hope that you feel this exam challenges you, teaches you, and prepares you to pass the AWS Certified Database - Specialty. If this is your first study guide, take a moment to relax. This could be the first step to a new high-paying job and an AMAZING career. If you\u2019ve been around the block a few times, consider taking a moment and answering some questions from newer techies. After all, it\u2019s our great community that illuminates the material and helps build something great.</p><p><strong>What Should You Know Before Studying The AWS Certified Database - Specialty?</strong></p><p>Every exam and certification has different requirements. If this is a serious venture, make sure to read the prerequisites before preceding. Nothing is worse than wasting months studying for an exam you can\u2019t take or passing an exam that won\u2019t help you get a certification! Our easy search tools are designed to help you find relevant information as well and search for a variety of different exams.</p><p><strong>What Is The AWS Certified Database - Specialty Focused On?</strong></p><p>The AWS Certified Database - Specialty or as it\u2019s also known, the <em>AWS Certified Database - Specialty</em>, like all tests, there is a bit of freedom on Amazon's part to exam an array of subjects. That means knowing the majority of AWS Certified Database - Specialty content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the AWS Certified Database - Specialty but it may take some extra work.</p><p><strong>Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day</strong></p><p>Remember that incredible things take time. And just like ancient monuments took years of effort, certification is not easy. It is not always quick either. But it is worth it! Our toolset allows you to engage with an incredible community of expert tech workers and add to the conversation. If you have questions, don\u2019t forget to leave a comment and reach out. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll get personalized help unheard of on test prep sites, without the outrageous fees.</p><p><strong>Always Check The Foundation</strong></p><p>Some certifications have requirements going back to older exams, while others use two or more tests to help someone pass. If you find the AWS Certified Database - Specialty is over your head, that\u2019s ok. It might make sense to see if a lower level exam will give you some clarity.</p><p><strong>If Offered, Read The Exam Objectives</strong></p><p>The exam objectives are different for every single exam and usually provided by the certification provider. These normally tell the test taker what subjects are relevant, what they need to know, and why the exam seeks to cover these topics. It\u2019s important to find them out for your specific exam. This can be found on nearly every vendor website and greatly informs the way you\u2019ll study! Don\u2019t worry though, we have taken those objectives into account and seek to create a testing experience comparable to an actual exam.</p><p><strong>Remember That Certification Is Quite Rewarding</strong></p><p>It can be hard to keep your focus on studying but remember that the best jobs in the world are only a few tests away. Whether you enter Cyber Security or do entry level tech work, certification is a clear, learnable, and rewarding path to careers that pay a LOT of money. They offer better work-life balance and you\u2019ll get in with some of the major leaders in the business world. So don\u2019t give up, it is worth it, and all this work will pay off!</p><p><br></p><p>This credential helps organizations identify and develop talent with critical skills for implementing cloud initiatives.

I was young, broke, and all I had was a dream, all I needed was the information and guidance.</p><p>As times changed, I had to adapt to constantly changing technology. I learned a lot about filmmaking from the Internet, but there was one thing that I couldn't find online, and that is how to actually make my own film. A real film, a feature film. A film that I can share with the whole world. A film that I can watch on TV. I needed to find a way to make a film without relying on people donating their money for my film or without hurting friends and family by asking them to help me make my film.</p><p>So that's what I did. I rolled my sleeves and jumped into self-education. As years went on I made mistakes, I improved, and I learned from my own failures. And this is what this course is all about.

The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

The voice seeks and Google\u2019s set of new rules and RankBrain are the opposite AI improvements, as discussed earlier. Some different innovations which can be widely used nowadays encompass, Google Home, Amazon Echo, Apple\u2019s Siri, and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana make it convenient for human beings to carry out searches by simply urgent a button or pronouncing a voice command.</p><p>AI-based CRM (customer relationship management) tools make it convenient to maximise the gathering of consumer details and facts from special technologies utilised and this process can be fully automated too. It additionally helps to gain unique insights into target audiences and identify customers\u2019 needs so that groups can establish the most suitable advertising strategy.</p><p>This behavioural data makes it easy for the brands to apprehend clients\u2019 temper. For instance, the kinds of products someone buys, pages they browse, which gear they regularly use, etc. With all of these accrued facts, marketers can without problems examine a capacity client's needs, and adapt AI used to grow income.</p><p><strong>A note on&nbsp;Artificial Intelligence in&nbsp;Digital Marketing (2022 Gold Edition)&nbsp;- The Course</strong></p><p>This&nbsp;game-changing&nbsp;course taught in 2022 will cover<strong>&nbsp;artificial intelligence tools in content creation, curation, augmented reality,</strong> and digital marketing and will take you on a glimpse into the future. We will also look at influencer marketing tools, content trends and a bit of competitor analysis through the use of BuzzSumo.</p><p><strong><em>Why learn this amazing artificial intelligence course and how is this a differentiator for content creators?</em></strong></p><p>This course can change your life if you are a content expert. Because, I will provide you with hands-on experience in creating tons and tons of articles for your blog for inbound marketing using an Artificial Intelligence content tool and you don\u2019t even have to write the content yourself - ever again.

The way consumers respond to marketing messages and interact with them is changing. Traditional methods of marketing such as media advertising and direct mail are no longer as successful as they were once.</p><p>One reason for this is that today's consumers expect marketers to adapt their demographics or preferences to their messages. Artificial Intelligence is starting to go hand in hand with digital marketing. AI transforms digital strategy with the ability to collect data, interpret it, apply it, and then learn from it. The ability to use it to improve digital marketing strategies and valuable customer insights for companies will be the same as it continues to advance. Excellent customer service is the also most important aspect of an effective digital marketing campaign this too can be automated by Google Duplex kind of tools that are created in the market.</p><p>Why is this secretive course in <strong>\"Artificial Intelligence in Digital Marketing -&nbsp;Gold Edition\" </strong>- the best one in the industry?</p><p>Artificial intelligence keeps growing and improving and will not slow down for a while.

The ultimate secret of the course is that we will also tell you about a tool that you can use for unlimited lead-generation using another secretive artificial intelligence&nbsp;(AI) technology. There is often a disconnection between sales and marketing departments in many businesses. This is typically due to a lack of interaction or shared attention. Marketers may give sales a lead they believe to be ideal, but sales are not. It creates tension between two teams to work together, and AI is the perfect way to bring them together. AI can point out positive sales leads, which will also satisfy marketing, and ensure that potential customers are targeted at the right platforms. You don't want the company that sells accounting software to be advertised by someone. All teams will need to come together and agree on an optimal customer profile, a profile that fits marketing and sales, to better use AI in the B2B lead generation.</p><p>The profile can consist of multiple variables, such as sector, company level, and how many employees they have. The standards are almost infinite. The AI will use the profile to measure current and potential leads against a selection of pre-defined behavioural criteria. Without us providing all this, the AI will fumble around, essentially throwing darts at a board while blindfolded. The AI can predict future patterns for lead generation, possible spending, and what campaigns or services will draw their interest from this. Ok, having given all this information that focuses on \"Artificial intelligence in digital marketing\", the question is&nbsp;<strong>\"Are you ready to get into action and embrace the power to leverage artificial intelligence in digital marketing?\u201d.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>If yes, plunge into action right away by signing up NOW.

However, while AI and machine learning are rapidly altering our environment and propelling the Fourth Industrial Revolution, humanity does not need to be concerned. Artificial Intelligence (AI) will provide people with the ability to focus on the aspects of their occupations or jobs that are most rewarding to them and the time is coming soon. </em></p><p>We must also note that Artificial intelligence is influencing the future of almost every sector and every person on the planet. Artificial intelligence has acted as the driving force behind developing technologies such as big data, robotics, and the Internet of Things, and it will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. From super-intelligence assistants like SIRI to self-driving cars, <strong><em>Artificial intelligence</em></strong> (<strong><em>AI</em></strong>) is progressing at a super-rapid pace. AI is believed to become the biggest business opportunity of the next decade and many more decades to come. The rise of AI will not be a threat in this new world order; rather, it will be a tremendous benefit. Not only is AI poised to impact the future of every single person and organisation in the world, but it is also poised to change the future of whole countries' governments, politics, and economies. As we move toward a world of totally automated work, we'll need to start adopting new rules and ideas. We'll have to start thinking about the future more than we do now.</p><p><strong>The Future of Jobs in the 21st Century:</strong></p><p>The 21st century is inching toward what many believe is the singularity or the time when manual work will all die out. There are still many jobs that we will have on our resume, but they will be less glamorous, fewer in number, and have little to do with our lives. We'll have far more disposable income, but it will be much greater still. The work, which will often be a repetitive, uninteresting and boring part of our jobs, will be replaced by the jobs of a new, automated digital future. This new age of automation and digital replacement will be of tremendous benefit to everyone but the workers themselves. The work will be performed on smart cloud computers and brilliantly capable-intelligent devices, which should offer us less of a challenge than ever before in recent history. If the future is any indication, a new and entirely digital world is now on the horizon. We are already seeing the results of this transition, with computers working across disciplines and tasks. </p><p>One of the newest and most amazing technologies is 3D printing, a process that is being used to create amazing items of art. This may not be practical, but it is something new that is just beginning to be experienced. People are inventing more and more advanced ways of creating things, not just for themselves, but for others. Even more incredible, our ability to design and create artificial intelligence and machines with their own personalities and motivations is being brought into the picture. As we make the machines smarter and more capable, each individual will have a role that is different than they would in any other scenario of the future. </p><p>Many people see artificial intelligence as a danger, and they see the power of artificial intelligence in our personal lives, in our jobs, in our families. Artificial intelligence has created problems for many people. There is another possibility that has come along that we can think is a bit better, to begin with than what we are seeing today. One such possibility is a group that believes it can reverse engineer human DNA and then create a new biological \"self.\" For this to happen, however, scientists first have to figure out a way to reverse engineer human DNA. Since we don't have the technological capability to reverse engineer human DNA today, this can be an extremely difficult path for anyone to take. The solution might not even be discovered until very late in the game until hundreds of years to come, however, and perhaps even we could lose much of our future. </p><p>Let's now talk about digital mind clone software where we can store our thoughts and ideas. We can use this tool to copy information from digital computers which have digital copies of our thought or ideas in a cloud database. </p><p><strong>What do you mean by \"The&nbsp;Digital Brain\"?</strong></p><p>The brain as you know it is an abstract concept in human psychology that involves a person's mind and a physical brain that controls its behaviour. Our brain is made up of hundreds of nerve cells and cells within the spinal cord that create all mental commands that happen to us.</p><p><strong><em>A digital brain is made up of billions of thoughts, ideas and stored emotions in its software or application program. Our emotions create a sense of being.</em></strong> Without emotional input and with our emotions our thoughts are useless and are therefore very vulnerable to manipulation. As a result, people tend to get bored quickly and don't need to be reminded of their problems, problems and challenges because they have the information they need quickly. But to take advantage of this capability - they need to learn to deal with problems, to deal with their emotions.</p><p>To store our emotions in a computer program portrays the future of Artificial Intelligence technology evolution and it remains to be the best example. </p><p><strong>What is the mechanism behind the power of Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI) and the world-changing technologies that are fastly emerging?</strong></p><p>The artificial intelligence or machine learning algorithms in our systems learn from their previous experiences while evaluating and creating predictions for users. Unlike people, these systems are not constrained by physical limits. AI may be programmed to do a wide range of tasks that need a combination of human and algorithmic intelligence. Speech recognition, text production, translation, and even a mixture of these functions can all be implemented into an AI. However, when it comes to AI, you must select the appropriate algorithms or machine learning techniques for the task at hand.</p><p><strong>What is covered in this online course?</strong></p><p>In this most incredible course <strong>\"Digishock 3.0: The Future of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\"</strong> Digital Marketing Legend <strong>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"&nbsp;</strong>takes you on a journey far into the future in a world ruled by Artificial&nbsp;Intelligence (AI)&nbsp;Technologies.

That's one of the reasons why the digital web is increasingly becoming the backbone of video.</p><p>In hopes of expanding their following, creators convert their work into a video for YouTube, like young actors flocking to Hollywood for more exposure.</p><p>Podcasts have quickly gained prominence in just the last few years. Most of the main reasons for this was the transition to smartphones; customers switch away from desktops and more frequently use handheld devices. Also, search engines adjust their algorithms to offer mobile priority, making it more important than ever for organizations to concentrate on web or app optimization. As people rely more on mobile devices, viewing, uploading, and listening to podcasts has been simpler than ever, wherever and whenever. Another factor fueling podcasts' success is the lack of time for people. We appear to be busier than ever and the reality makes it impossible to calm down, read a book, or even watch a TV show without interruption. People like multitasking and doing as much as possible, and podcasts make it easy to listen on a drive, on a hike, while doing housework, and so on. </p><p>This compelling course focussed on<strong> \"Space Render 2.0: Transform your podcast into videos (2022)\"</strong>, takes a step further from the previous courses in&nbsp;Level 3 to completely open a new path for users to focus on podcast creation, marketing, and monetization using automation tools.

Their role is actually quite simple. They help us answer three questions: What do I want to change about myself, How do I change,&nbsp; How do I commit to changing, Whether it\u2019s being a better lawyer, a leader or manager or whether it\u2019s more personal, such as getting in shape, losing weight, being a better parent, change starts with identifying what you want to change about yourself, figuring out how to get from here to there and making that change a reality. Life coaches help you do this. They help you to get to know yourself better, define what you really want and work with you on how to get it. Successful individuals set goals and pursue them. When we feel stuck, we\u2019re in a rut, or we find ourselves asking, How did I get here? we know we need to make a change, but we have difficulty defining the change and have less of an idea of how to make it.&nbsp; life coach helps you answer these questions.</p><p>A life coach can lead you to water but can\u2019t make you drink.

This is where the best of intentions only get you so far. This is where it\u2019s you changing, ever so incrementally, step by step, inch by inch, making a new you. Your life coach can offer advice, motivation and inspiration but you\u2019re the one on the field. You\u2019re the one running and hustling, blocking and tackling, throwing and receiving, making the moves and making the plays. In short, a life coach is just that a coach</p><p>a life coach helps you figure things out, but once you have strategy, it\u2019s up to you to execute. he\u2019s not there to hold your hand or carry you across the finish line. he helps you be the brains of the operation. good life coach has a process for you to follow to determine what you want to change, how to change it and how to stick with it through the end. You two are co-architects and you\u2019re the contractor.</p><p>Neuroplasticity can be defined as brain\u2019s ability to change, remodel and reorganize for purpose of better ability to adapt to new situations. Despite the fact that the concept of neuroplasticity is quite new, it is one of the most important discoveries in neuroscience. The fact is that neural networks are not fixed, but occurring and disappearing dynamically throughout our whole life, depending on experiences. While we repeatedly practice one activity such as a sequence of movements or a mathematical problem, neuronal circuits are being formed, leading to better ability to perform the practiced task with less waste of energy. Once we stop practicing a certain activity, the brain will redirect these neuronal circuits by a much known 'use it or lose it\u2019 principle. Neuroplasticity leads to many different occurrences, such as habituation, sensitization to a certain position, medication tolerance, even recovery following brain injury</p><p>Our brains are truly extraordinary; unlike computers, which are built to certain specifications and receive software updates periodically, our brains can actually receive hardware updates in addition to software updates. Different pathways form and fall dormant, are created and are discarded, according to our experiences.</p><p>When we learn something new, we create new connections between our neurons. We rewire our brains to adapt to new circumstances. This happens on a daily basis, but it\u2019s also something that we can encourage and stimulate.</p><p>it was discovered that neurons could reorganize after a traumatic event. Further research found that stress can change not only the functions but also the structure of the brain itself</p><p>Although related, neuroplasticity and neurogenesis are two different concepts.</p><p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to form new connections and pathways and change how its circuits are wired; neurogenesis is the even more amazing ability of the brain to grow new neurons</p><ol><li><p>Neuroplasticity is one fundamental process that describes any change in final neural activity or behavioral response, or;</p></li><li><p>Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term for a vast collection of different brain change and adaptation phenomena.</p></li></ol>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4456056/preview/?startPreviewId=38471428", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "4369378", "category": "Development", "sub_category": "Programming Languages", "title": "Moonbeam ile Ak\u0131ll\u0131 Kontrat Geli\u015ftirme", "content_length": "246", "level": "Beginner Level", "author": "Bugra & \u015eebnem Ayan", "rating": "4.9", "reviews": "45", "students": "5151", "coupon_code": "BABAKURUDUKBE", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/4369378_abc4_2.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/moonbeam/?couponCode=BABAKURUDUKBE", "expired_date": "2022-09-15 17:32:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "703", "headline": "Moonbeam Blokzincir Teknolojisini Kullanarak Ak\u0131ll\u0131 Kontrat Geli\u015ftirme", "description": "<p>Harika!

This includes web pages that contain forms asking for usernames, passwords,\u00a0credit cards and other sensitive\u00a0information.\u00a0<br><br>In the near future Google plans to roll out a requirement for all web pages to be secured. Warning labels will become progressively more aggressive, and eventually highlighted in red, bold colors on the address bar.\u00a0<br><br>It is easy to see the consequences of not complying with this new requirement. You invest time, money and energy to drive traffic to your website. Your users expect a secure browsing experience and will likely be deterred from using your page when they see such warning labels attached.\u00a0<br><br>There is a common misconception that securing a webpage over HTTPS requires expert server knowledge and is a costly and cumbersome process.\u00a0<br><br>The purpose of this course is designed to teach you everything you need to know about HTTPS and SSL certificates.

Exploring the theory and definitions that will be useful in developing your understanding.\u00a0<br><br>From there, we dive into configuring a server on Digital Ocean and installing a free SSL certificate known as Let's Encrypt.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Experts say that while Android&nbsp;OS will help companies to grow, developing a creator community will be crucial. This is what the top companies in the world has been concentrating on recently.</p><p>Clubhouse, like any other social media platform has the potential to be a double-edged sword. Either way, you'll either waste time bouncing in and out of different conversations or you'll be able to make relationships with individuals all over the world.</p><p>Clubhouse is clearly gaining popularity in the face of intense competition from Twitter Spaces and other digital heavyweights such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Spotify, and Reddit, all of whom are developing Clubhouse-like platforms.</p><p>The biggest question that will come to your mind - Is there a future for audio after the epidemic, or will it fade out once we can converse and listen in person? The answer can already be found in the first sentence. </p><p>Audio social media systems appear to fulfil a long-held goal for free and democratic social media. Decentralisation offers a wide range of applications, from cryptocurrency to social media. Unlike podcasts or livestreams, social audio platforms are more of an open conversation than a monologue. Even if you're in a chatroom full of strangers, group voice chats feel strangely intimate. Audio social media platforms allow users a more democratic option to get their opinion heard in a world where platforms are becoming pay-to-play. </p><p>Brands may be able to test audio-based ad formats on audio social networks at some point in the future. They would also be able to \"sponsor\" particular discussions, similar to how adverts appear on streaming radio and podcasts. Individual chat rooms would most likely have audio advertising \u2014 a company representative or host would provide a short commercial at the start, middle, and/or end of a conversation. Social audio platforms tend to draw niche audiences, ranging from astrology enthusiasts to side hustlers, providing the ideal opportunity for companies to get in front of their target audience in an audio format. </p><p>Accessibility is critical to the development of social media. Some apps or software as we know it are inaccessible to persons who are deaf or hard of hearing due to their audio-only nature. Discord has added certain accessibility features, including text-to-speech and greater screen-reader integration, in response to similar criticisms. Audio platforms must ensure that their platform is accessible to everyone in order to survive. </p><p>One way audio platforms keep users interested is through attracting influencers and celebrities who funnel their audience from other media. Allowing live talks to be recorded and distributed in a podcast format may also assist platforms attract listeners who are unable to attend live chats.&nbsp;Keep that in mind.</p><p>Now, let's talk about how <strong><em>\"Space Render&nbsp;Classic Edition:&nbsp;Create Live Audio Rooms\"</em></strong> course made by Digital Marketing Legend <strong><em>\"Srinidhi&nbsp;Ranganathan\"</em></strong>&nbsp; fits here and is deemed to be world-changing.</p><p>In this mind-blowing course, we will look at hosting audio-based events from a marketers' point of view to promote himself or herself via a web-portal.&nbsp;Imagine marketing yourself on a browser instead of a mobile app. This seems to be something like Clubhouse for web. Once we've gone through the web portal, we will look at how you can post recorded events and make it seemingly live for the audience who pay a ticket to enter the show. Isn't this amazing?&nbsp;This is sheer monetisation opportunity - we're talking about. </p><p>What's more?&nbsp;We will also look at certain platforms that allow you to embed a club-house like audio rooms on your own website. In the special lecture, we will be exploring a tool that allows you to share the recordings as a podcast and monetise them, also.</p><p>Why wait? We advise you to try out the social audio platforms taught in the course, keep an ear out for advertising opportunities, and start thinking about how to engage with your audiences or fans in an audible way - whatsoever.</p><p>1....2....3.....Enroll Now.

You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Mental disorders negatively affect the quality of life for the person as well as his or her family. Many of these disorders (including depression, anxiety) have been shown to respond well to CBT. we face increased demands for efficient and cost-effective health care services.
