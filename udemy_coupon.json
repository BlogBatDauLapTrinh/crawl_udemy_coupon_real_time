It's important to know what you want to achieve in order to choose the right objective. Your advertising objective is what you want people to do when they see your ads. For example, if you want to show your website to people interested in your business, you can create ads that encourage people to visit your website. As your business grows, your campaign goals will change. First, your campaigns may focus on building awareness and acquiring new customers. Later, you may encourage people to make a purchase or sign up for an event.</p><p><em>DAY 3: Learn How to Use Facebook Ads Library</em></p><p>Facebook Ads Library was designed to give anyone and everyone accesses to advertising taking place on Facebook. This approach is to promote transparency sharing as much information as possible. You have access to a collection of all advertisements running from across Facebook Products, including Instagram.</p><p><em>DAY 4: Learn Copywriting for your Facebook Ads. Create your own Facebook Ad Copy.</em></p><ol><li><p>Put all crucial info at the start of your copy</p></li><li><p>Emojis are your best friend</p></li><li><p>Keep it brief</p></li><li><p>Give people a reason to purchase</p></li><li><p>Remember \u2013 it\u2019s always about the sell.</p></li><li><p>Create copy tailored to your audience.</p></li><li><p>Use power words to inspire emotion.</p></li><li><p>Include social proof.</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 5: Learn How to Setup &amp; Use Facebook Business Manager</em></p><p>The purpose of Facebook Business Manager is to help you \u201cmanage ad accounts, Facebook pages, and the people who work on them \u2014 all in one place.\u201d Business Manager is more or less the hub for accessing all of your Facebook marketing needs, including ad accounts, catalogs, pixels, and business pages.</p><p><em>DAY 6: Learn How to Proceed Domain Verification</em></p><p>Apple has announced changes with iOS 14 that impact how Facebook receives and processes conversion events from business tools like the Facebook pixel. Domain verification helps Facebook ensure that only the rightful parties can edit link previews that direct to your content. Once you have verified your domain, you can assign specific Pages editing permissions for your ads. Pages associated with your Business Manager that do not have editing permissions won\u2019t be able to make changes to your ads.</p><p><em>It's free to verify your domains. There are 3 domain verification methods:</em></p><ol><li><p>Add a meta tag to your domain's home page</p></li><li><p>Upload an HTML file to your web directory and confirm ownership of your domain in Business Manager</p></li><li><p>Add a DNS TXT entry to your DNS record to confirm ownership of your domain</p></li></ol><p><em>DAY 7: Learn How to Easily Setup Facebook Pixel &amp; Conversion API on WordPress</em></p><p>When you use the Conversions API along with our other Facebook Business Tools, you can gain additional insights into the people who interact with your business. Best practice is to use the Conversions API in addition to the Facebook pixel to help maximize the effectiveness of your website events.</p><p>The Conversions API is designed to create a direct and reliable connection between marketing data (such as website events and offline conversions) from your server, website platform or CRM to Facebook. This marketing data helps power ad personalization, optimization and measurement on Facebook so that your ads are shown to people who are more likely to be interested in them. There are several options you can use to set up the Conversions API. Many integrations don't require a developer, and if you use a commerce platform such as Shopify you can set up the Conversions API in just a few clicks.</p><p><em>The Conversions API can help you to:</em></p><ul><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of improved connectivity. Data from the Conversions API is less impacted than the pixel by browser loading errors, connectivity issues and ad blockers. When you use the Conversions API alongside the pixel, it creates a more reliable connection that helps the delivery system decrease your cost per action.</p></li><li><p>Optimize ads for actions that happen later in the customer\u2019s journey. Examples of these events include actions that happen after a purchase (such as subscriptions), actions that happen in stores, or even customer scores. This information helps Facebook show your ads to customers who are more likely to be profitable and generate value for your business.</p></li><li><p>Improve measurement. The Conversions API can help you better measure ad performance and attribution across your customer\u2019s full journey, from discovery to conversion. This helps you better understand how digital advertising impacts both online and offline results.</p></li><li><p>Reduce your cost per action as a result of increased event matching. Your marketing data is most effective when it can be matched with accounts on Facebook apps and services. With the Conversions API, you can include additional customer information parameters that help increase matched events and your Event Match Quality score.</p></li><li><p>Increase data control. When implemented separately from the pixel, the Conversions API gives you more control over what you share and when you share it.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 8: Learn How to Use &amp; Setup Pixel Events. Learn Using Events Manager.</em></p><p>Facebook uses marketing data to show ads to people who are likely to be interested in them. One type of marketing data is website events, which are actions that people take on your website. For example, making a purchase or adding an item to their cart. As people interact with your business, integration methods like the Conversions API and Facebook pixel share those events with Facebook. Events help power your Facebook ads so you can reach a more relevant audience, provide a more personalized ad experience and optimize your ad campaigns towards better business outcomes. Events take place either as a result of Facebook ads (paid) or organic reach (unpaid).</p><p><em>DAY 9: Learn How to Use, Setup &amp; Optimise Facebook Aggregated Events</em></p><p>Facebook\u2019s Aggregated Event Measurement is a protocol that allows for measurement of web events from iOS 14 users. Aggregated Event Measurement limits domains to 8 conversion events that can be prioritized for conversion optimization. So, please, learn with me Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads for 2023. If you optimize your ads for non-prioritized events, your ads won\u2019t deliver to and report on people who are opted-out of tracking on their Facebook or Instagram apps on an iOS 14.5 or later device. Facebook solution is analogous to Apple\u2019s Private Click Measurement, but it is designed to solve for key advertiser use cases not addressed by Apple\u2019s proposal. </p><p><em>DAY 10: Learn Facebook Reach Ads</em></p><p>The reach objective maximizes the number of people who see your ads and how often they see them. Choose this objective if you want to build brand awareness, change brand perception or show your ad to as many people in your audience as possible. With this objective, you can choose to maximize your reach or impressions for the entire duration of your campaign. You can set frequency controls for how many times a person sees your ad and the minimum number of days between each time they see it. For example, let's say you want your ads to reach a large proportion of your target audience to help increase sales. You can also tailor your reach with location targeting to reach people within a certain radius of your business location. You can simply choose the reach objective to show ads to a larger portion of your audience.</p><p><em>DAY 11: Learn Facebook Traffic Ads</em></p><p>The traffic objective is designed to drive people to your website or app. With traffic as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Send people to a destination such as a website, app, phone call or Messenger conversation (Website Clicks)</p></li><li><p>Increase the number of people going to your mobile or desktop app (App Engagement)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 12: Learn Detailed Targeting on Facebook &amp; Creating your Persona</em></p><p>Define your audience for smarter ad targeting.With Core Audiences, you set the rules for where your ads are delivered. Adjust your target audience to be as broad or well-defined as you like, based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li><p>Location.Advertise in the cities, communities and countries where you want to do business.</p></li><li><p>Demographics. Choose your audience based on age, gender, education, job title and more. You can keep track of the types of people your ads are reaching, but Facebook will never share personally-identifiable information about them.</p></li><li><p>Interests. Add interests and hobbies of the people you want your ad to reach \u2013 from organic food to action films \u2013 and make your targeted ads more relevant.</p></li><li><p>Behaviour. Target your ads based on consumer behaviours such as prior purchases and device usage.</p></li><li><p>Connections. Choose to include people who are connected to your Facebook Page or event, or exclude them to find new audiences.</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 13: Learn How to Create Attractive Video Carousels for Facebook Ads &amp; Instagram Ads</em></p><p>The carousel format lets you show 2 or more images and/or videos in a single ad, each with its own headline, description, link and call to action.

Create Powerful Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences from Engagement.</em></p><p>Nobody knows more about us than our mother, our wife, and Facebook. So it\u2019s very easy for Facebook to create an exact lookalike audience for you. For example, Facebook can create a very similar audience to people that have been already engaging with your content.</p><p><em>DAY 15: Learn Facebook Engagement Ads</em></p><p>The engagement objective is designed to get more people to see and engage with your Facebook post or Page. With engagement as your objective, you can create ads that:</p><ul><li><p>Boost your posts (Post Engagement)</p></li><li><p>Promote your Page (Page Likes)</p></li><li><p>Raise attendance at an event on your Page (Event Responses)</p></li></ul><p><em>DAY 16: Learn Facebook Lead Generation Ads</em></p><p>Lead generation is the process of building interest in a business's products or services. On Facebook, you can create campaigns using a lead generation objective that allows consumers to fill out a form, called an \"Instant Form,\" with their contact information.</p><p><em>DAY 17: Learn How to Use Custom &amp; Lookalike Audiences to Get Better Results</em></p><p>A Custom Audience is an ad targeting option that lets you find your existing audiences among people who are on Facebook. A lookalike audience is a way your ads can reach new people who are likely to be interested in your business because they share similar characteristics to your existing customers. </p><p><em>DAY 18: Learn Conversion Ads &amp; Commerce Manager</em></p><p>The Facebook Website Conversion objective helps you to grow business on your website.

Encourage people to visit a specific page or explore your whole website.</p></li></ul><p>Conversion ads are special kinds of ads where Facebook, Messenger and Instagram are trying their best to drive audiences to your website that are more likely to buy your products or give you a lead. For these ads you often have to retarget with custom and lookalike audiences. You mainly retarget your website visitors and already engaged people from your Facebook business page and Instagram profile. As every business is different, you can also test standard targeting based on age, interests, location and income.</p><p><em>DAY 19: Learn How to Create Attractive Carousels for E-Commerce</em></p><p><em>You can use carousel ads to sell more on your E-Commerce:</em></p><ul><li><p>Feature multiple products that link to different landing pages.

Since then, it has been widely adopted in a variety of industries.</p><p>The Greek letter sigma is used by statisticians to represent the variation in a process and we all know that. Six Sigma is usually defined as \u201cA fact-based, data-driven philosophy of improvement that favours defect prevention over defect detection\".</p><p>Six Sigma practitioners have created a variety of methodologies over the years to make the approach to these initiatives consistent and driven by tactics that have proven successful over time. Six Sigma aspires to do the following - in general:</p><ul><li><p>Determine a problem.</p></li><li><p>Gather information about the problem's occurrence process.</p></li><li><p>Develop prospective problem-solving data-driven solutions.</p></li><li><p>To determine the best alternative, put the solutions to the test.</p></li><li><p>Create a system that will allow you to maintain a long-term solution.</p></li><li><p>Analyze the data and make any necessary adjustments. </p></li></ul><p>Let's get down to what this online course talks about. This course teaches you the fundamentals of Six Sigma. It not just helps with change management within your company but also helps your organization to prepare for the new normal. Customer expectations or demands are constantly changing in this world governed by technology. Six Sigma's emphasis on customer satisfaction enables the company to produce higher-quality products and increase customer loyalty over time. A product-focused strategy compares the product to the products of competitors in order to reach or slightly exceed such levels. You must know that Six Sigma focuses on minimising process variation and improving process control, whereas lean encourages work standardisation and flow by eliminating waste (non-value added processes and procedures).</p><p>Please note that to achieve success leveraging the Six Sigma methodology, organisational processes must have a failure rate of no more than 3.4 per million (99.99966%) chances. A Six Sigma defect is anything that isn't according to the client's specifications. Its goal is to reduce the amount of variation in commercial and production operations. The capacity to focus on producing quantitative and measurable financial gains from any Six Sigma project is one of the most notable features. Employees can identify problem areas as well as reoccurring difficulties that affect the overall quality expectation of a service or product from a customer's perspective using Six Sigma methodology.</p><p><strong>Why opt for this course - the proven game-changer?</strong></p><p>By completing this<strong> \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Online Course\"</strong>, you will gain the basic understanding of what Lean Six Sigma is and how Lean Six Sigma brings a plethora of benefits to your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a professional individual who wants to grow and sustain in this ever-changing competitive world (where speed is no longer just a good to have criteria) and want to discover a way to fit in the new norms with their employees - this course is for you to learn and master!</p><p><em>This mind-blowing White belt course will walk you through unbelievable insights and learning that you don't want to miss at all as a newbie entering the world of Lean Six Sigma.&nbsp;What's more? We will teach you the five core skills of Lean Six Sigma that can be leveraged for individuals.

But when people found out how to game Page Rank, Google lost the ability to detect what was a good link and a bad one, which reduced their ranking algorithms effectiveness.</p><p>In 2012 Google made some crucial updates, to weed out shady black hat link building techniques and better determine quality links. They now place a lot of importance on link quality, as well as quantity, meaning where your link appears is just as crucial, if not more, as how many links you get.</p><p>Now Google regularly penalizes websites who use black hat techniques or over-optimise with low-quality link building. The value of certain techniques such as submitting your site to web directories has also fallen, due to being repeatedly overused.</p><p>Search engines use backlinks to find out about new web pages, which they then include in search results. They also use them to evaluate a page\u2019s ranking position within search results.</p><p>Even though there have been a lot of changes, links are still critical if you want to rank well on Google. But employing low-quality link building techniques is not only a waste of your time and effort - but it could also actively damage your website\u2019s ranking.</p><p>The bottom line is backlinks are still so vital to your visibility in search, they are Google\u2019s key ranking signal. It\u2019s <em>pivotal</em> to learn the most current white hat techniques that will help you acquire great backlinks, so keep watching as we show you what to avoid, and what to do in order to build high quality backlinks this year.</p><p><strong>What can Link Building do for you?</strong></p><p>Link building is important if you\u2019re looking to build relationships with people in your industry for two primary reasons.</p><ol><li><p>It can help you acquire valuable backlinks on highly relevant, popular sites, but it also aids you in making connections over the long term. When you contact an influencer, site owner, or blogger with a well-written pitch that demonstrates the value of linking to you, you make that all-important first contact with someone who can be incredibly influential in your niche.</p></li><li><p>Even if they don\u2019t say yes, the first time around, providing your pitch is polite and relevant, you\u2019ll have made that all-important first contact. Next time, they might well say yes, or they might even come to you.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Get the RIGHT kind of traffic</strong></p><p>Links are incredibly useful for boosting your referral traffic and if you get a backlink on a popular website in your niche, you\u2019ll likely see a significant increase in visitors. As the traffic will already be pre-screened for interest, if your link appears on a relevant site, rather than a more general one - it\u2019s more likely to convert.</p><p>Getting your content, products, or services in front of people who are interested is a superb way to up the value of your links. Even if they don\u2019t buy from you right away, you\u2019ve raised your profile to an ideal target audience. This is something you should always be looking to do if your goal is to boost your SEO and expand your business.</p><p><strong>Establish your brand authority</strong></p><p>Your link building strategy can also help solidify your brand authority, particularly if you create content that\u2019s relevant to what you offer, and valuable to potential customers.</p><p>If you have a sportswear e-commerce store for example and published a piece entitled <em>\u201cGo from couch potato to 10K runner in 6 months\u201d</em>, this would be extremely relevant to a significant portion of your audience.</p><p>There\u2019s three ways you can benefit here.</p><ol><li><p>First, you\u2019re attracting people to your brand, who\u2019ve searched for the terms your piece has ranked for. Now they know who you are and are more likely to consider you an authority on a subject they are interested in.</p></li><li><p>Secondly, you\u2019ll raise your site authority with Google if enough people link to your piece, which also helps to boost your search engine ranking.</p></li><li><p>Thirdly, you may make some sales, if you link smartly to your products in the piece, or at the end, or if you include offers placed well around your article.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What\u2019s a hyperlink made of?</strong></p><p>To comprehend properly how links work and how search engines read them, you first need to understand all the different parts of a hyperlink - and what function they play.</p><p><strong>There are four main parts:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Anchor tag</p></li><li><p>Href</p></li><li><p>Anchor text</p></li><li><p>Tag closure</p></li></ul><p>Let\u2019s take a quick look at what these different parts do\u2026</p><p><strong>Anchor tag </strong>- This is the part of your link that opens your link tag and lets search engines know a link is included.</p><p><strong>Href</strong> - Href is short for hyperlink referral and is the text inside the quote marks that shows where your URL is pointed to. It basically tells your browser where it needs to head to, whether that\u2019s a web page, image, or a file.</p><p><strong>Anchor text</strong> - This is the visible text that people click on when they open your link. It\u2019s often formatted differently from the rest of the text surrounding it, typically with an underline or blue colour to show it has been clickable.</p><p><strong>Tag closure</strong> - This one\u2019s pretty straightforward, it\u2019s the part of your link that lets the search engines know it\u2019s now the end of your tag.</p><p><strong>How to get Links Google LOVES</strong></p><p>Your focus should be on acquiring links that will have a positive impact on your Google rank, and often the best kinds of links are the ones you never even asked for.</p><p>You get these types of links by consistently creating something of quality, whether that\u2019s informative content, a unique website, or a really great product or service. When you do this regularly, people notice - and they naturally want to link to you.</p><p>Though you should <em>always </em>be trying to achieve these kinds of organic links, you shouldn\u2019t sit around waiting for people to link to your site. Instead, actively help to raise more awareness of your brand and content by using a link building strategy that boosts your Google rankings.</p><p>While not all Google ranking factors are known, there are many which most experts agree have a definite impact on your search position. Start watching as we\u2019re about to reveal the most important Google ranking factors you need to be aware of when it comes to link building.</p><p><strong>We really hope you will love learning all about backlinks and how to build them!</strong></p><p>Ing.

The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1.

Digital Forensics Police", "description": "<p><strong><em>*Get the Official Certificate after Completing the Course</em></strong></p><p>Welcome to the 21st century, where almost everything is connected to a computer. Digital cameras<strong> </strong>are built into doorbells; your smartphone tracks your daily movements from work to home and back; and you receive social media updates when you go to the gym, see a show, or visit a new city. Digital technology tracks your phone calls, bank transactions, and medical appointments. What about criminal or unethical behavior if it tracks your mundane daily activities?</p><p>That activity is also monitored, and as a<strong> </strong>digital forensic investigator, you'll need to understand where digital evidence is stored and how to analyse it. There is almost no criminal activity that does not involve digital evidence, and it is your responsibility as an investigator to gather all available evidence, process it, and present your findings to the authorities.</p><p>Investigators who work in the field of digital forensics must have a diverse set of skills and interests. The first question I ask anyone thinking about a career in this field is if they enjoy solving puzzles. You may not have access to any information other than the fact that something happened when investigating a case. So, if someone needs to be shown or told what happened, this field may not be right for them. When a case is brought to an investigator's attention, the investigator is often given instructions to figure out what the computer or device was used for.</p><p>Another important trait is the ability to deal with frustration, as investigative tools and software do not always work without problems. When it comes to cell phones and small devices, this is a fairly common occurrence. Many students, rather than working through the challenges, stop their investigation in class at the first sign of difficulty.

The more polite you are, the more likely people will be to work with you and enhance your friendships. When you have respect and trust between people, communication remains effective even if a person doesn't understand a particular language. When you practice business etiquette, you're more likely to actively listen, give constructive feedback, pay attention to what someone says, smile, make eye contact with them, talk clearly and avoid words or language that could get misunderstood, and other appropriate things to do.</p><p>There's more to business etiquette than just speaking. Additionally, it includes non-verbal cues and an overall demeanor. A diverse workforce means dressing and looking in a way that doesn't offend or upset others. Dressing and acting professionally is part of business etiquette, and taking cues from others is part of it too. Business etiquette also requires respect for other people's space and time. Be punctual for meetings, arrive at the workplace on time, and conduct your business in a way that won't inconvenience anyone. Take cues from others you work with so your behavior aligns with their needs and expectations. As mentioned earlier, business etiquette is a code of conduct that isn't just for the top brass of the company. It must be part of the company's culture and values. Several jobs may require a more elevated form of business etiquette than others. For example, customer service, sales, marketing and other roles like these require employees to be aware of business etiquette.</p><p>In this master course you can learn the 5 Major topics,</p><p>1.

To get a better idea of the possible demand for used cars in your area, you\u2019ll need to crunch some numbers. By knowing the number of used cars sold in your area every year and month , you can estimate what percentage of the market you will be likely to be able to corner and reach. By locating the average profit per vehicle, you can get an approximate idea of how much profit and money your dealership able to make per year. While the groundwork associated with opening a dealership can be time-consuming, expensive, and demanding, the real test of your dealership\u2019s viability doesn\u2019t begin until after you open your doors to the public. Without the right management of your dealership, all the effort you put into laying the foundation will be wasted. While each state has its own rules and regulations, there are several important universal aspects of operating a car dealership and tips on how you can get the most out of your investment. Your customers are the single most important factor in the success or failure of your business, so taking the time to identify who they are and what they care about is absolutely vital. Take a look at the types of cars you plan on selling, then do some research to determine the age, gender, and income level of the average individual who owns those types of vehicles. Later down the line, this will allow you to tailor your marketing and advertising efforts toward those who are most likely to be interested in what you have to offer. Make sure to base any of your conclusions regarding your target clients on real actionable data; don\u2019t simply make assumptions.</p><p><br></p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4741312/preview/?startPreviewId=42015852", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "3649540", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "QuickBooks Enterprise-Classes-Responsibility Accounting", "content_length": "157", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "36", "students": "17334", "coupon_code": "6ECE3361B88EEE4A3F3D", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/3649540_efe9.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-enterprise-classes-responsibility-accounting/?couponCode=6ECE3361B88EEE4A3F3D", "expired_date": "2023-01-11 05:26:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "948", "headline": "Learn responsibility accounting using class tracking for both the balance sheet and profit and loss from a CPA", "description": "<p>This course is a project-based course using the free trial version of QuickBooks Enterprise, practicing the feature of class tracking for both the balance sheet and profit and loss, the class tracking feature applied to responsibility accounting.</p><p>We will learn how to download the free trial version of QuickBooks Enterprise and set up a new company file to work in.</p><p>The course will show how to turn on the class tracking feature and discuss the differences between class tracking for the QuickBooks Pro version of the software and the QuickBooks Enterprise version.</p><p>We will record expenses by department using the class tracing feature and learn how to allocate indirect expenses.</p><p>The course will then demonstrate how to allocate service center expenses to revenue centers.</p><p>We will also consider adjustments to the balance sheet as we generate balance sheet reports by class.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/3649540/preview/?startPreviewId=29414894", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2797342", "category": "Office Productivity", "sub_category": "Other Office Productivity", "title": "QuickBooks Online vs Xero Accounting Software", "content_length": "3838", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.5", "reviews": "135", "students": "20856", "coupon_code": "4852D044A70DA1C94235", "preview_img": "https://img-b.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2797342_60f8.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/quickbooks-online-vs-xero-accounting-software-2020/?couponCode=4852D044A70DA1C94235", "expired_date": "2023-01-14 05:03:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "950", "headline": "Compare leading online software packages with a practicing Certified Public Accountant (CPA)", "description": "<p>This course will compare two leading online accounting software applications, QuickBooks Online and Xero, in a step by step format.</p><p>This is a comprehensive accounting course.</p><p>We will discuss the purchasing options and the best tools to learn these accounting software packages at the lowest cost.</p><p>Learners will understand how to set up a new company file in each software package.</p><p>The course will demonstrate how to navigate each software package and how to generate, analyze, and customize common financial reports.</p><p>We will learn how to create inventory and service items and how they are used to create invoices, purchase orders, and sales receipts.</p><p>The course will show how to enter two months of data in a step by step process, comparing the two accounting software packages at every level along the way.</p><p>The course will demonstrate how to complete bank reconciliations and enter adjusting and reversing entries.</p><p>We will also learn how bank feeds work.

In less than two hours, we will go through every step of a machine learning project that will provide us with an accurate telecom customer churn prediction in the end. This is going to be a fully hands-on experience, so roll up your sleeves and prepare to give it your best!</p><p><strong>First and foremost, how does Apache Spark machine learning work?</strong></p><p>Before you learn Apache Spark, you need to know it comes with a few inbuilt libraries. One of them is called MLlib. To put it simply, it allows the Spark Core to perform machine learning tasks \u2013 and (as you will see in this Apache Spark tutorial) does it in breathtaking speed. Due to its ability to handle significant amounts of data, Apache Spark is perfect for tasks related to machine learning, as it can ensure more accurate results when training algorithms.</p><p>Mastering Apache Spark machine learning can also be a skill highly sought after by employers and headhunters: more and more companies get interested in applying machine learning solutions for business analytics, security, or customer service. Hence, this practical Apache Spark tutorial can become your first step towards a lucrative career!</p><p><strong>Learn Apache Spark by creating a project from A to Z yourself!</strong></p><p>I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t included any purely theoretical lectures in this Apache Spark tutorial: you will learn everything on the way and be able to put it into practice straight away. Seeing the way each feature works will help you learn Apache Spark machine learning thoroughly by heart.</p><p>I will also be providing some materials in ZIP archives. Make sure to download them at the beginning of the course, as you will not be able to continue with the project without it.</p><p><strong>And that\u2019s not all you\u2019re getting from this course \u2013 can you believe it?</strong></p><p>Apart from Spark itself, I will also introduce you to Databricks \u2013 a platform that simplifies handling and organizing data for Spark. It\u2019s been founded by the same team that initially started Spark, too. In this course, I will explain how to create an account on Databricks and use its Notebook feature for writing and organizing your code.</p><p>After you finish my Apache Spark tutorial, you will have a fully functioning telecom customer churn prediction project.

The term digital forensics was originally used as a synonym for <strong>computer forensics</strong> but has expanded to cover investigation of all devices capable of storing digital data. With roots in the personal computing revolution of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the discipline evolved in a haphazard manner during the 1990s, and it was not until the early 21st century that national policies emerged.</p><p>Digital forensics investigations have a variety of applications. The most common is to support or refute a hypothesis before criminal or civil courts. Criminal cases involve the alleged breaking of laws that are defined by legislation and that are enforced by the police and prosecuted by the state, such as theft and assault against the person. Civil cases on the other hand deal with protecting the rights and property of individuals (often associated with family disputes) but may also be concerned with contractual disputes between commercial entities where a form of digital forensics referred to as electronic discovery (discovery) may be involved</p><p>During the 1980s very few specialized digital forensic tools existed, and consequently investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers from within the operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.</p><p>Digital forensics is commonly used in both criminal law and private investigation. Traditionally it has been associated with criminal law, where evidence is collected to support or oppose a hypothesis before the courts. As with other areas of forensics this is often a part of a wider investigation spanning a number of disciplines. In some cases, the collected evidence is used as a form of intelligence gathering, used for other purposes than court proceedings (for example to locate, identify or halt other crimes). As a result, intelligence gathering is sometimes held to a less strict forensic standard.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4372164/preview/?startPreviewId=38948904", "language": "English"}, {"course_id": "2547827", "category": "Finance & Accounting", "sub_category": "Accounting & Bookkeeping", "title": "Not-for-Profit Accounting-Charities, Colleges, & Health Care", "content_length": "1153", "level": "All Levels", "author": "Robert (Bob) Steele", "rating": "4.3", "reviews": "109", "students": "37631", "coupon_code": "2848B44F649516333DB9", "preview_img": "https://img-c.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/2547827_39ef.jpg", "coupon_link": "https://www.udemy.com/course/not-for-profit-accounting-charities-colleges-health-care/?couponCode=2848B44F649516333DB9", "expired_date": "2023-01-14 05:06:00+00:00", "uses_remaining": "921", "headline": "Learn Not-for-Profit accounting from a practicing CPA", "description": "<p>Not for Profit Accounting-Charities, Colleges, &amp; Health Care will cover accounting principles related to not for profit organizations.</p><p>Our concentration will be on nongovernmental not-for-profit organizations.

Kotlin has classes with constructors, along with nested, inner, and anonymous inner classes, and it has interfaces like Java 8. Kotlin does <em>not</em> have a new keyword. To create a class instance, call the constructor just like a regular function. We saw that in the screenshot above.</p><p>Kotlin has single inheritance from a named superclass, and all Kotlin classes have a default superclass Any, which is <em>not</em> the same as the Java base class java.lang.Object. Any contains only three predefined member functions: equals(), hashCode(), and toString().</p><p>Kotlin classes have to be marked with the open keyword in order to allow other classes to inherit from them; Java classes are kind of the opposite, as they are inheritable <em>unless</em> marked with the final keyword. To override a superclass method, the method itself must be marked open, and the subclass method must be marked override. This is all of a piece with Kotlin\u2019s philosophy of making things explicit rather than relying on defaults. In this particular case, I can see where Kotlin\u2019s way of explicitly marking base class members as open for inheritance and derived class members as overrides avoids several kinds of common Java errors.</p><p>Then, you'll learn how to create apps and run them on virtual devices through guided exercises. You'll cover the fundamentals of Android development, from structuring an app to building out the UI with Activities and Fragments and various navigation patterns. Progressing through the chapters and lectures, you'll delve into Android's RecyclerView to make the most of displaying lists of data and become comfortable with fetching data from a web service and handling images. You'll then learn about mapping, location services, and the permissions model before working with notifications and how to persist data. Moving on, you'll get to grips with testing, covering the full spectrum of the test pyramid. You'll also learn how AAC (Android Architecture Components) are used to cleanly structure your code and explore various architecture patterns and the benefits of dependency injection. <em>The core libraries of RxJava and Coroutines are covered for asynchronous programming</em>. The focus then returns to the UI, demonstrating how to add motion and transitions when users interact with your apps. Towards the end, you'll build an interesting app to retrieve and display popular movies from a movie database, and then see how to publish your apps on Google Play. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills and confidence needed to build fully-fledged Android apps using Kotlin.</p><p>Are you trying to start a career in Android programming, but haven't found the right way in? Do you have a great idea for an app, but don't know how to make it a reality? Or maybe you're just frustrated that to learn Android, you must already know Kotlin. If so, then this course is for you</p><p>When Android first arrived in 2008, it was a bit drab compared to the much more stylish iOS on the Apple iPhone/iPad. But, quite quickly, through a variety of handset offers that struck a chord with practical, price-conscious consumers, as well as those who are fashion-conscious and tech-savvy, Android user numbers exploded. For many, myself included, developing for Android is the most rewarding pastime and business, bar none. Quickly putting together a prototype of an idea, refining it, and then deciding to run with it and wire it up into a fully-fledged app, is such an exciting and rewarding process. Any programming can be fun \u2013 I have been programming all my life \u2013 but creating for Android is somehow extraordinarily rewarding..</p><p><br></p><p>Kotlin is the most succinct language, and therefore is the least error-prone, <em>which is great for beginners</em>. Kotlin is also the most fun language, mainly because the succinctness means you can get results faster and with less code. Google considers Kotlin an official (first-class) Android language. There are some other advantages to Kotlin that make it less error-prone and less likely to make mistakes that cause crashes. We will discover the details of these advantages as we proceed.</p><p>Kotlin is an object-oriented language. This means that it uses the concept of reusable programming objects. If this sounds like technical jargon, another analogy will help. Kotlin enables us and others (like the Android API development team) to write code that can be structured based on real-world things, and here is the important part \u2013 it can be reused.</p>", "preview_video": "https://www.udemy.com/course/4365954/preview/?startPreviewId=38359186", "language": "English"}]}
