Let me say the way it is, your movie poster is the deciding factor for the audience when deciding what to watch. As simple as that. It's beyond important. Imagine getting home from work, getting comfortable on a sofa in front of your tv, and scrolling through hundreds of tv shows and movies deciding what to watch. </p><p>Subconsciously you will choose something that stands out from other films, and you will judge it by the poster. With years of making indie films and doing everything myself, I learned why my movies are not getting enough attention. That is not because of how good or how bad the movie is, sure it's important but it's not a deciding factor. In this course, you will learn how to design a great-looking film poster for a film that grabs attention and stands out among others. </p><p>We will go through everything from doing research, finding suitable images for your poster, putting it all together, and much more. This course also includes a Photoshop template you're welcome to use to follow the course and to create your future posters based on. Let's get to it.&nbsp; </p>",

            "description": "<p>Audit-Financial Accounting will discuss, in detail, the auditing process of financial statements.</p><p>The course will start by discussing what an audit is, as well as what the terms attest engagement and assurances services mean.</p><p>We will discuss the audit environment, the general format of a public accounting firm, and the general format of an audit team that would conduct the procedures related to an audit. The course will also discuss regulations and regulatory institutions related to the audit process.</p><p>The course will cover the planning process for an audit engagement. The planning process is a very important component of the audit because it will outline the steps that will be taking. The highest levels of the public accounting firm are generally involved in the planning process.</p><p>We will consider how to assess risk related to the audit using an audit risk Model. The risk assessment will help us plan the audit and determine where the auditors time can be spent most efficiently to gather evidence to support the auditor\u2019s conclusion and opinion.</p><p>Learners will learn the different formats of audit evidence and how to document audit evidence so that it can be used as evidence to support the conclusion and opinion of the auditor.</p><p>We will exam the internal controls of the organization. Internal controls are policies set up by management to achieve the objectives of the organization. As auditors, we are primarily concerned with internal controls that will lower the risk of financial statements being materially misstated. If we can rely on internal controls as an auditor, we may be able to do more testing of the controls and less substantive testing, and this can be more efficient.</p><p>The course will discuss the audit sampling methods. When applying testing procedures, auditors often need to test a sample of a population and then apply the results to the population as a whole. Different sampling methods are appropriate for different situations and assertions being tested.</p><p>Next, we will talk about substantive tests. Substantive tests include tests that most people think of when they think of an audit, like pulling files, counting inventory, and performing procedures at the company\u2019s place of business. Substantive testing will include testing account balances and transactions.</p><p>We will then cover audit procedures related to specific processes, including the revenue process, the purchasing process, and the payroll and human resources process.</p><p>Next will cover the audit process for specific accounts like inventory, prepaid expenses, intangible assets, property plant and equipment, long term debt &amp; equity.</p><p>Then we will discuss the audit process related to cash, cash being a very important account because it is involved in almost every other accounting process at some point.</p><p>Learners will then learn how to put together a standard audit report. The standard audit report is called an unqualifies report. It is beneficial to actually memorize or have a good idea of the format of the standard unqualifies report. We can then think about variations on the standard unqualified report, adjusting it as necessary.</p><p><strong>CPE&nbsp;(Continuing Professional Education)</strong></p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>1. Describe what an audit engagement is and the objectives of the audit engagement</p><p>2. Explain how learning the audit process can enhance an accountant\u2019s understanding of financial accounting concepts</p><p>3.

            "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Multithreading with Java Examples.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course!

            "description": "<p><strong>Hello my dear students,</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this course we will model a Magnificent, <strong>Cinematic 3D City Of Dragon</strong> with <strong>Blender 3D.</strong> In this Course, we will start a practice-based learning process by jumping into modelling practices with Blender. Working with Realistic Textures, we'll let you gain Expertise-level Blender skills! Of course, we will first get to know the Blender 3D program, then we will make excellent models. This course is an excellent resource for anyone who loves to learn and wants to advance the field of 3D modelling. 3D modelling is mainly used in animation movies, games, VFX (Visual Effects) creation, NFT collections and Metaverse Projects. Blender, on the other hand, is one of the incredible software that can do great work in all these areas. Plus Blender is completely FREE! <strong>And This course was created with the most current version of Blender software.</strong></p><p>Bring your dream 3D fantasy project to life! Specialize in Blender and improve your skills with the practical information in this course. Learn Realistic 3D modeling, which is the main support of movies and series in the genres of Sci-Fi &amp; Fantasy &amp; Action &amp; Adventure, with this course. You can always contact me for my support in the learning process!</p><p>What distinguishes this course from others is that it has a sculpting section.</p><p><strong>We will learn to design 3D scenes, which are the most important part of science fiction, action and thriller-themed productions that look like a fantastical land you watch in movies, and at the same time look realistic. And of course, the best advantage is that you always have the opportunity to contact me and forward your questions while you learn new information in my courses.</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In this lesson, we will create models for NFT and Metaverse projects with Blender 3D, one of the 3D modelling programs.</p><p><br></p><p>Now if you're ready, let's move on to the most frequently asked questions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What is NFT?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>The technology known as NFT, that is, Non-Fungible Token, proves the belonging of a picture, video, the sound or physical entity it represents. In other words, it helps us to own all virtual content. As a matter of fact, this technology is not so new, NFTs, whose foundations were laid in Ethereum in 2017, have become one of the most popular topics in the crypto money industry in 2021.</p><p><br></p><p>After completing this course, you will receive a certificate of attendance for completing the course!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what is the difference between NFTs?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Friends, NFTs cannot be divided, reproduced or repeated. In other words, content produced and sold in this way cannot be thousands like cryptocurrencies. Every NFT is special and therefore carries great meaning. The uniqueness of NFTs makes them much, much more meaningful. For example, cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH can be transferred by dividing them into fractions, while NFT is bought and sold alone as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So how are NFTs produced?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>As it is known, NFTs are produced according to the ERC-721 token standard prepared by Ethereum developers. NFT trading can be carried out on special platforms established for NFTs by avoiding the intense code complexity of the IT world.</p><p><br></p><p>NFT is a digital asset so you need a digital blockchain wallet for that. For this, the widely used METAMASK wallets can be preferred. We have covered the METAMASK wallet setup in detail in our courses. We invite everyone who does not want to miss the train on NFTs to our platform. After you upload the file you want to print as NFT to the IPFS system via these platforms, you need to provide some information for this NFT. You should write information such as NFT sales price, name, number. Once the transaction is complete, your content is transferred to the relevant wallet and saved on your preferred blockchain network.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How can I get NFT?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>You can buy and sell NFTs on special platforms prepared for this.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are NFT sales types?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NFTs are usually sold as eth. Some NFT manufacturers sell their NFTs by auction, while others set a direct selling price for the new one.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>In which sectors is NFT used?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>In almost all current technologies, a place is reserved for NFT content. NFTs are sometimes used as a ticket when registering, when logging in, and sometimes as a reward or tool in games. In fact, some NFT communities may impose an obligation to buy NFT as a condition to help each other, so people who want to help by joining the community and get support from people who are more experienced than themselves can pay comfortably for only 1 NFT up to 20 thousand dollars.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Is NFT an investment?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>I think absolutely yes because in one way or another you are paying for a digital piece of art. You can buy and sell this work on the NFT marketplace. The rarity of the piece in your hand multiplies its value.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What impact will NFTs have on the Future?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NFTs are a technology focused on solving the intellectual property problem. As you know, the future is built on the Blockchain network, and we can say that this network is the ground floor of the world of the future. The systems established years ago on this ground now enrich this field by bringing the technology of ownership. Just as there are land sales in METAVERSE technologies, the importance of immutable tokens in this field is proven exponentially day by day.</p><p><br></p><p>With its programmable feature, the first producer of the work on all platforms can determine the royalty fee from each purchase and sale while the work is in circulation. In this way, the fee determined when the sale is made can be transferred directly to the seller's account.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What are the most notable sales of recent times?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) has sold a collage of his works for $69.4 million at auction by the auction house Christie's. Lebron James' slam dunk video NFT sold for $77,000 via the NBA Top Shot app. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's tweet was bought by a Turkish person for $2.9 million.</p><p><br></p><p>There are millions of sales transactions like this. The basic stages of NFT projects are quality information, quality content, quality marketing and proper function. It is the quality that sets it apart from the others that pave the way for an NFT to find buyers. This is where we step in. We enable you to gain expertise by teaching you the 3D basics. In this way, you will be able to create quality works with the knowledge and skills you have acquired.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What will we add to you?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Our courses will not only give you NFT training but also provide 3D modelling training. In this way, you can easily use it in animation movies, games, NFTs, and Metaverse projects.</p><p><br></p><p><strong> I am happy to tell you that our course is regularly updated simultaneously with the blender versions.</strong></p><p>I need to briefly explain to you what you can do with Blender 3D and how your skills improve rapidly as you work with it.</p><p><br></p><p>I plan and publish all my courses in a targeted manner. So, I present you with practical tips and modeling techniques so that there is no crowd of information and no waste of time. You can use all the tools you model in this course as a 3D Metaverse model in Metaverse applications and games. You can also browse my 3D character modeling course for NFT and Metaverse that I published on Udemy before and learn in detail how to render the assets you have created. Although the concepts of Metaverse, NFT and Crypto have just entered our agenda, they have the potential to respond to the very important demands of humanity. It is certain that the whole world needs investment and qualified manpower in this field, and there will be more. My courses will help you with practical and non-confusing specific information. And that will make me very happy to have students who are building the world of the future. Metaverse, NFT and digital art technology is an important and highly lucrative opportunity for aspiring designers.</p><p><br></p><p>First of all, it is very easy to become a blender expert because this software is completely free and has a very clear interface for modeling beginners. With Blender you can:</p><p><br></p><p>-You can make awesome 3D printed things.</p><p><br></p><p>-You can create assets for every video games.</p><p><br></p><p>-You can create 3D models for many NFT platforms on Ethereum and other cryptocurrency chains.</p><p><br></p><p>- And the most important thing:</p><p>You will gain 3D modeling practice, which forms the basis of METAVERSE technology, which is the technology of the future.</p><p><br></p><p>-You can earn money by creating eye-catching models to sell in 3D model markets.</p><p><br></p><p>-You can design your fav character, environments, builds or etc...</p><p><br></p><p>-As a freelancer, you can get involved in modeling projects around the world and earn thousands of dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>-and unbelievably but so much more you can learn this program with me. At the end of the course, you will receive your certificate of completion with the assurance of Udemy!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learn Blender 3D modeling for use in 3D NFT projects, 3D Metaverse project, 3D Crypto arts, 3D collections, 3D printing,&nbsp; animated movies, video games and more.

In this course, I teach very useful shortcuts to students who use the Blender program and want to improve their skills.Together we will model a Magic Village and add color&nbsp; material. While doing this, I will teach you easy shortcuts that make a difference by improving your skills.</p><p><br></p><p>3D characters or, in other words, \"3d avatars\" are powerful parts of the virtual colorful world of the future. We will hear terms such as CryptoArt, blockchain, metaverse, NFTs more often and louder in the future. With the expansion of the color palette of the NFT world, the sector is getting more and more valuable and attracts the attention of many giant companies. For this reason, the need for Expert Crypto Artist, NFT designers, 3D modeling experts is increasing day by day on a global scale.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what does metaverse mean? What is the connection between 3D NFT and Metaverse technologies?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NFTs are mostly virtual works of art; consists of music, painting, digital arts, 3D models. It's pretty easy to diversify. 3D modeling has an extremely critical role at the core of these new technologies. With 3D modeling, you can design NFTs, create Metaverse characters, create 3D Assests for virtual plots you buy on Metaverse platforms, and color your own world. Models that you will display exclusively as your own design offer you a technological and cutting-edge opportunity to create virtual value. You can set up your own team with 3D models and NFT and Metaverse characters that you will create with my 3D metaverse and NFT collections design courses. Just focus! A team of software developers and 3D designers can build a 3D metaverse. For this original metaverse, you can create your own NFT exhibit by designing 3D NFTs! The only thing you need for all this; It's a strong start.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The word metaverse is very popular today, when the blockchain technology, which started to develop a long time ago, is at its peak. To simplify this concept, which many of us have heard for the first time; we can call it multiple virtual universes.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that Metaverse technology brings together institutions and individuals in an online environment modeled and created in 3D represents a bit of teleportation technology. Because this innovation will renew the definition of sociability as everyone is included in the universe by choosing their own unique avatars.</p><p><br></p><p>As we all know, many Mega companies are investing heavily to develop VR glasses. Although it is still not widely used in many countries, this technology will shape the future. Because touch phones, which are owned by almost everyone nowadays, were not a technology that everyone could reach once.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In summary, what do you need for this course;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>-An ordinary computer.and the Blender 3D program installed on your computer (you can download it for free from the Blender official site.)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course will guide you through:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>-3D Modeling</p><p><br></p><p>-3D Design</p><p><br></p><p>-3D Texturing</p><p><br></p><p>-3D Rigging</p><p>&nbsp; </p><p><br></p>",

Although some records suggest that chickens were raised around 3200 BC, archaeological evidence only goes back to about 2000 BC. It is considered that chickens originate from India, and that the red jungle fowl is an ancestor to today\u2019s modern chicken. The breeding of chickens in captivity dates back to at least 1400 BC in Egypt. But intensive poultry production only&nbsp; before 7500 BCE.

In 1878, a company in St. Louis, Missouri started to transform egg yolk and white into a light-brown, meal-like substance by using a drying process.&nbsp; &nbsp;intensive poultry production only began in the 20th century. Indeed, the past 100 years have seen an impressive growth, chiefly in the production of chickens and eggs, turkeys, ducks, and geese.

            "description": "<p>From this course, you can learn <strong>Java Collections Framework, together with Generics, Lambda Functions, Method References, and Stream API. </strong></p><p>There are a lot of other courses on this topic. <strong>So, why would you choose exactly this course?&nbsp; </strong>Here are just a few reasons:<br><br><strong>- Coding examples</strong></p><p>To learn to program is not enough just watching videos and reading books. You also need to have a lot of practice. In this training course, you will review multiple practical tasks and coding examples which will help you learn and understand Java better.</p><p><br><strong>- Open source code</strong></p><p>We hide nothing from our students!&nbsp;Including the source code for the home task solutions and source code of examples that were shared during the lesson. Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait! Take a look at the lessons' preview if you still have doubts! </p><p><strong><em>Buy this course today, and you will get all updates for FREE! </em></strong></p><p>For those who successfully passed this training course, or for students who were recognized for asking amazing questions, there is a special offer from the IT-Bulls company! The creator of this course is IT-Bulls company CEO&nbsp;and Founder. We are always in search of talents to run our amazing startups together with you. Probably you always dreamed about running your startup?&nbsp;In this course, you will be able to find the team who will teach you how to do that and (in particular cases) will be glad to help with implementation! </p><p>Hope you enjoy this course!

We do recommend spending time learning the full accounting process, and we do have a course that does this.</strong></p><p><strong>However, many small businesses want to get right down to data input as fast as possible, and others already have a good understanding of the system and want to focus specifically on bank feeds.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will do just that.</strong></p><p><strong>For example, some small businesses may be perfectly happy using a cash basis system and will, therefore, not need some of the functions used in a full accounting cycle. Businesses that use a cash basis model can structure their data input to be much more heavily dependent on the bank and bank feed data.</strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss types of businesses that fit well into a cash basis model as we work through the practice problems. We will also discuss some problem areas many businesses have and how to set up a system that works.</strong></p><p><strong>This course will work through a practice problem and will provide test data that learners can use in their system to follow along if they choose.</strong></p><p><strong>One obstacle to learning bank feeds is access to a clean QuickBooks file to practice with. Here are some options you can use along with this course:</strong></p><p><strong>Intuit (the owner of QuickBooks) provides a free test drive available to anybody. You can find it by searching in your favorite browser (QuickBooks Test Drive).</strong></p><p><strong>Intuit often provides (almost always) a 30 day discount period. You can use the 30 days to practice by starting the 30-day trial, practicing with the data we provide in the course, and then canceling after the 30 days.</strong></p><p><strong>Intuit also provides discounts or a free version for students and educators.</strong></p><p><strong>Check with your accountant or CPA firm, and they may be able to provide a discount on QuickBooks Online</strong></p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Your Journey To Pass The AWS Certified Database - Specialty</strong></p><p>Perhaps this is your first step toward the certification, or perhaps you are coming back for another round. We hope that you feel this exam challenges you, teaches you, and prepares you to pass the AWS Certified Database - Specialty. If this is your first study guide, take a moment to relax. This could be the first step to a new high-paying job and an AMAZING career. If you\u2019ve been around the block a few times, consider taking a moment and answering some questions from newer techies. After all, it\u2019s our great community that illuminates the material and helps build something great.</p><p><strong>What Should You Know Before Studying The AWS Certified Database - Specialty?</strong></p><p>Every exam and certification has different requirements. If this is a serious venture, make sure to read the prerequisites before preceding. Nothing is worse than wasting months studying for an exam you can\u2019t take or passing an exam that won\u2019t help you get a certification! Our easy search tools are designed to help you find relevant information as well and search for a variety of different exams.</p><p><strong>What Is The AWS Certified Database - Specialty Focused On?</strong></p><p>The AWS Certified Database - Specialty or as it\u2019s also known, the <em>AWS Certified Database - Specialty</em>, like all tests, there is a bit of freedom on Amazon's part to exam an array of subjects. That means knowing the majority of AWS Certified Database - Specialty content is required because they test randomly on the many subjects available. Be aware too that experience requirements often exist because they\u2019ve observed the average person and what is required. You can always push past that to succeed with the AWS Certified Database - Specialty but it may take some extra work.</p><p><strong>Rome Wasn\u2019t Built In A Day</strong></p><p>Remember that incredible things take time. And just like ancient monuments took years of effort, certification is not easy. It is not always quick either. But it is worth it! Our toolset allows you to engage with an incredible community of expert tech workers and add to the conversation. If you have questions, don\u2019t forget to leave a comment and reach out. It\u2019s here that you\u2019ll get personalized help unheard of on test prep sites, without the outrageous fees.</p><p><strong>Always Check The Foundation</strong></p><p>Some certifications have requirements going back to older exams, while others use two or more tests to help someone pass. If you find the AWS Certified Database - Specialty is over your head, that\u2019s ok. It might make sense to see if a lower level exam will give you some clarity.</p><p><strong>If Offered, Read The Exam Objectives</strong></p><p>The exam objectives are different for every single exam and usually provided by the certification provider. These normally tell the test taker what subjects are relevant, what they need to know, and why the exam seeks to cover these topics. It\u2019s important to find them out for your specific exam. This can be found on nearly every vendor website and greatly informs the way you\u2019ll study! Don\u2019t worry though, we have taken those objectives into account and seek to create a testing experience comparable to an actual exam.</p><p><strong>Remember That Certification Is Quite Rewarding</strong></p><p>It can be hard to keep your focus on studying but remember that the best jobs in the world are only a few tests away. Whether you enter Cyber Security or do entry level tech work, certification is a clear, learnable, and rewarding path to careers that pay a LOT of money. They offer better work-life balance and you\u2019ll get in with some of the major leaders in the business world. So don\u2019t give up, it is worth it, and all this work will pay off!</p><p><br></p><p>This credential helps organizations identify and develop talent with critical skills for implementing cloud initiatives. Earning AWS Certified Database \u2013 Specialty validates expertise in recommending, designing, and maintaining optimal AWS database solutions.</p>",

Having the source code you can just copy and paste it to run it on your local computer to understand how things work better.</p><p>You are allowed to use all source code examples for learning purposes. This helps significantly to configure the environment and make tests work, especially in case students didn't work with any testing framework in the past.<br></p><p><strong>- Q&amp;A support&nbsp; </strong></p><p>The significant difference between the online and offline learning process is the instructor's availability. If you are in one room with a tutor he always can help you to get understand the specific concept or to help fix your code on your computer. <br>In this course, we are supporting students with answers to any questions flagged in the Q&amp;A section. In case there will be recurring questions - separate video lessons will be created to show how to address the issue. </p><p><strong><em>So with this course you are not just getting video materials, code exercises, source code, access to the free mobile application without limits (which is still pretty cool, huh?&nbsp;:)&nbsp;), but you also get tutor support and answers to your questions along with this course. </em></strong><br><br><strong>- Relevant knowledge</strong></p><p>After our team investigated other Java courses on Udemy we realized that most of them have nothing in common with real life. The information which is shared there is very old and significantly out of date. For example, the instructor teaches a framework which is not been used already for 15 years. Or instructors do stress on the programming design which is not used anymore at all!</p><p>The instructor of this course is a consultant in a top-rated IT&nbsp;outsourcing company and helps to bring cutting-edge solutions in IT for all his clients. Feel free to check the LinkedIn page of the instructor and check skills endorsement. More than 19 thousand people across all over the world (BTW&nbsp;most of them are from the top 100 companies of the world) evaluated the skills of Andrii Piatakha. </p><p>With this course, you can be sure that you will spend your time learning the right things from one of the best IT&nbsp;consultants in the world. <br></p><p><strong>- Free mobile App without limits for our students</strong></p><p>Knowing Java is one skill. Be able to pass interviews in the company - that is another skill :)&nbsp;Nowadays a lot of companies use tests to select candidates on the first level of interview. We developed applications to practice skills specifically for such purposes. </p><p>In this course, we will provide you link to download our FREE&nbsp;mobile app for android. (soon it will be also available for iOS platforms) </p><p>The instructor of this course comes up with hundreds of tests that are used to test the knowledge of candidates. With this application, you will be well-prepared for the interview. </p><p>Also, <strong><em>only for our students - there is no limit on attempts to pass certification. </em></strong>In the course, we will tell you how to set up a special bonus code that will remove restrictions for our students inside the app.<br></p><p><strong>- High concentration of useful material in each lesson</strong></p><p>Sometimes you can notice that watching 5 minutes of our lesson is equivalent to watching another 30 minutes lesson. </p><p>This is because time spent for preparation for the lesson (script for the lesson, lesson structure) and video editing (to cut boring pieces of the lesson or time when the program loads) sometimes <strong><em>10 times as much (sometimes even 20)</em></strong> as the final lesson duration after video editing.</p><p>Also, each topic is separated from another. In case some concept will be explained in the next lesson and you don't need to worry about understanding this in the scope of this lesson - the instructor will make an announcement when a specific topic will be covered. </p><p>Go and try it yourself!&nbsp;We will appreciate your feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>So don't wait!

Similar Excel worksheets to the ones we will construct can be useful for analyzing many areas of accounting, and the Excel skills learned in creating them are also very applicable both inside accounting and outside of it. </strong></p><p><strong>We will discuss the reasons for creating an adjusting and tax entries Excel worksheet. Some benefits of the Excel worksheet include the ability to enter adjusting entries in an efficient way and build an adjusted trial balance, the ability to enter tax entries efficiently and build a trial balance on a tax basis, and the ability to reconcile book net income and tax net income. </strong></p><p><strong>An Excel worksheet can be used to show the difference between net income on the unadjusted trial balance, the adjusted trial balance, and tax trial balance in an easy visual way. A worksheet can be used as a reference to communicate to supervisors, clients, and as a reference for us to look back at in the future. </strong></p><p><strong>The course will build an Excel worksheet from scratch providing tools to help with the construction for each step along the way. We will provide an updated Excel worksheet for most steps, allowing us to jump forward or to rework any part of the course without starting over. The Excel worksheets will generally have at least two tabs, one with the completed step, showing the end product, and one that has been completed up to the current step in the process, allowing us to fill it in with the help of the instructional video and the Excel tab showing the completed work. </strong></p><p><strong>We will then practice entering some adjusting entries and tax entries into the worksheet.

To put it simply, the moment you will decide to become a movie director your life won't be the same anymore. Quite literally. You'll need to go above and beyond not only to make your films but also to maintain that life you're living. Being a movie director comes with enormous outside pressure, risks, challenges, and constant obstacles that you will have to battle on daily basis. </p><p>In this course, we will cover some of the challenges that every director faces and talk about tips and tricks that will help you become a better director. Traditionally a film director controls artistic and dramatic aspects of a movie-making, bringing words written in a screenplay to screen by working with actors, but in the modern world that is not the case anymore. And sometimes it\u2019s really easy to lose the way. You'll have to do so much more if you want to keep making films. </p><p>I've been making films for many years now and I've learned a lot from my past films, and the mistakes I made along the road. And in this course, I want to show you my perspective and share the tips that helped me deal with challenges and obstacles.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Advanced financial accounting will focus heavily on intercorporate acquisitions and investments in other entities.</p><p>Why learn advanced accounting?</p><p>Even if we do not work in an area that applies advanced accounting concepts directly, learning them is very useful, because it refines our skills on the understanding of double-entry accounting, its concepts, and practical application.</p><p>Advanced financial accounting is also a standardized topic often found on exams like the CPA exam.</p><p>This course will break down the complex concepts in advance financial accounting in a way we can easily grasp. How?</p><p>We will break down the very large concepts covered into digestible parts. We will organize those parts in a way in which they build on one another logically, allowing us to develop our knowledge in a systematic, practical, and efficient way.</p><p>We will approach each new section from a variety of angles, including:</p><p>\u00b7 PowerPoint presentations discussing the latest concepts in a discussion format</p><p>\u00b7 Practice problem demonstrations using video recordings taken of presentations created using OneNote</p><p>\u00b7 Excel problems we will demonstrate in a step by step process</p><p>Learners will have access to the PowerPoint presentations in PDF format. They will also have access to an outline of the resources in OneNote.</p><p>Learners will have downloadable Excel files, each having at least two tabs, one with the answer, one with a preformatted Excel worksheet learners can use to work through the problem in a step by step approach.</p><p>We also do our best to add a trial balance and show the big picture as we learn new concepts, a step often missed in many classes. In other words, by the time we get to advanced financial accounting, many instructors expect us to be able to visualize everything that has been learned up to this point, and only show the new concepts. In reality, even seasoned professionals will have a difficult time imagining all the complexities that can go on in a consolidation without the help of supporting tools like a trial balance to work with.</p><p>We will show the trail balance, show each journal entry in our practice problem, and post each entry to a worksheet so we can see the results as we go. No guessing where a number came from in this course.</p><p>While learning consolidation, we will start with easier problems where the subsidiary is 100% owned by the parent company.</p><p>We will then add differentials between the fair value and book value at the point of purchase.</p><p>The course will move to conciliation where the subsidiary is not 100% owned, resulting in us accounting for the noncontrolling interest.</p><p>We will add intercompany transfers such as upstream (subsidiary to parent) and downstream (parent to subsidiary) sales of equipment and inventory.</p><p>Learners will learn how to account for intercompany transactions related to debt, bonds, and interest.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Marketing for thinkers and creators - What's missing?</strong></p><p>After analyzing 30 marketing courses, I found something is missing. What is missing is a clear structure, a strong foundation. On top of that, there seem to be no marketing courses for people who are not wired to be an entrepreneur.</p><p>Now the good news. The good news is that I worked on a strong foundation for a big part of my life and used that in the course. That is the course ZEN and the art of making a living as a 3d artist.</p><p>While this course is tailored to 3d artists, I recommend this course for anyone who is a thinker, creator, innovator, or introvert. It is not a static course, but its content is expanding and improving. On top of that, there is a Facebook group and a Discord Server dedicated to the course.</p><p><strong>Another problem that artists encounter</strong></p><p>Most artists are looking for jobs online rather than starting their own businesses. The most common searches are these:</p><ul><li><p>3d artist jobs</p></li><li><p>3d artist salary</p></li><li><p>remote 3d artist jobs</p></li><li><p>3d environment artist jobs</p></li><li><p>3d character artist jobs</p></li><li><p>3d artist jobs near me</p></li><li><p>senior 3d artist salary</p></li></ul><p>And there are no searches such as \"How to make a living as a 3d artist\". Again, this indicates what mindset an artist, thinker, or innovator is using. While there are loads of jobs related to 3d, design, content creation, it's still hard to find a job. For example, there are jobs, but not close enough. Or the job is asking for skill sets that don't match completely. Another one is that you don't have the experience that is asked for. </p><p>The solution is to look from another perspective, from the entrepreneurial perspective. This way, you open many doors. Not only can you be your own boss, but you create more reasons for others to engage with you. </p><p><strong>The solution</strong></p><p>This course offers many solutions. First, it shows a strong foundation for thinking, feeling, acting, and feeling like an entrepreneur. Secondly, you will be your own boss of your thoughts and feelings. And finally, you will gain insight into marketing strategies. </p><p><strong>Take action now</strong></p><p>The first step is to get this course now. You can always ask for a refund if the course is not for you. So you can only win. Mind that this course is life-changing on different levels if you believe in it. And you can help other artists, thinkers, and creators by engagement. For example, provide feedback, give a rating or review, and engage in the Facebook Group and Discord. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

Most of the time, we research what technical books to read, what courses to watch, which field to go into, web development, mobile development, or something else. The Technology, the tool - we get so involved in this wide array of choices, and so there is something very foundational that we might miss if we don\u2019t pay enough attention and get lost in the technicality.</p><p><br></p><p>There is a set of skills known as \u201csoft\u201d skills, and that forms the 'EI' or '<strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong>'.</p><p><br></p><p>Emotional intelligence is something everyone has, but which few of us really know how to channel or develop. Many Software Developers wrongly believe it to be a quality they simply don\u2019t possess \u2013 and that if they weren\u2019t born with it, it\u2019s something there\u2019s no hope of attaining later in life. But the good news for all of us is that emotional intelligence in general, and empathy in particular, are things we can train ourselves to have more of. </p><p><br></p><p>More and more employers are looking for coders and Software Developers who have the right set of \u201csoft skills\u201d, such as the ability to work well with a team, to empathize with coworkers and customers, and to de-escalate emotional situations. All of these skills require a high degree of emotional intelligence. What is emotional intelligence, and why is it important? And how can software engineers, coders and programmers develop emotional intelligence before or during their career? You\u2019ll learn the answers to those questions in this course.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I assure you that after taking this course you'll say : </strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>I\u2019ve come to understand why I previously avoided certain situations, the roots this had in particular emotions, and the impact all that had on my sense of self-worth.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Getting an insight into what people around me want, and why they do what they do, has become dramatically easier for me. </p></li><li><p>Because I can now understand them better, knowing how other people are probably going to act has become much easier. </p></li><li><p>I\u2019ve begun to find it much simpler to identify and engage in the small pleasures that brighten up my life and make me more productive.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>Difficult tasks like engaging in negotiation have come to be things I can take pleasure in. </p></li><li><p>My Development efficiency has increased well, and I am now able to respond well to negative situations like downtime, outages etc.</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Top Reasons why you should choose this Course :</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li><p>This course is designed keeping in mind the students from all backgrounds - hence we cover everything from basics like EI fundamentals, and gradually progress towards more important topics around EI, seeing some practical tips to improve.</p></li><li><p>This course can be completed over a Weekend.</p></li><li><p>This course covers end to end introduction to EI and guide to be better at it.</p></li><li><p>Useful resources will be shared time and again in the course to keep it updated with new ideas.</p></li><li><p>All Doubts will be answered.</p><p><br></p></li></ul><p>Most Importantly, Guidance is offered in detail regarding the smallest of things that matters !

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p><p><strong>What is the Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is a simple machine learning model for regression problems, i.e., when the target variable is a real value.</p><p>Linear regression is a linear model, e.g. a model that assumes a linear relationship between the input variables (x) and the single output variable (y). More specifically, that y can be calculated from a linear combination of the input variables (x).</p><p>When there is a single input variable (x), the method is referred to as simple linear regression.</p><p>When there are multiple input variables, the method is known as multiple linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning?</strong></p><p>There are four reasons to learn Linear regression technique of Machine learning:</p><p>1. Linear Regression is the most popular machine learning technique</p><p>2. Linear Regression has fairly good prediction accuracy</p><p>3. Linear Regression is simple to implement and easy to interpret</p><p>4. It gives you a firm base to start learning other advanced techniques of Machine Learning</p><p><strong>How much time does it take to learn Linear regression technique of machine learning?</strong></p><p>Linear Regression is easy but no one can determine the learning time it takes. It totally depends on you. The method we adopted to help you learn Linear regression starts from the basics and takes you to advanced level within hours. You can follow the same, but remember you can learn nothing without practicing it. Practice is the only way to remember whatever you have learnt. Therefore, we have also provided you with another data set to work on as a separate project of Linear regression.</p><p><strong>Why use Python for data Machine Learning?</strong></p><p>Understanding Python is one of the valuable skills needed for a career in Machine Learning.</p><p>Though it hasn\u2019t always been, Python is the programming language of choice for data science. Here\u2019s a brief history:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2016, it overtook R on Kaggle, the premier platform for data science competitions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2017, it overtook R on KDNuggets\u2019s annual poll of data scientists\u2019 most used tools.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In 2018, 66% of data scientists reported using Python daily, making it the number one tool for analytics professionals.</p><p>Machine Learning experts expect this trend to continue with increasing development in the Python ecosystem. And while your journey to learn Python programming may be just beginning, it\u2019s nice to know that employment opportunities are abundant (and growing) as well.</p>",

I was lucky to learn about the Problem Solving Methodologies from my earliest days in <strong>HUL and later in J&amp;J</strong>. My conviction about their usefulness further cemented once I took charge of the<strong> Operations and Supply chain in J&amp;J </strong>where we faced the same problems again and again. We trained all the Operations and Supply Chain team in these methodologies to find the astonishing results of customer service going and cost &amp; inventory coming down at the same time!</p><p>You can also get a <strong>Enrichmentors Course Completion Certificate cum Letter of Recommendation</strong> to whoever will complete their assignments and Practice Test successfully. These certificates will be signed by me and will be in addition to the normal Udemy Certificate you get on completion of the course. You will need to score 75% in the Practice Test and complete all the steps of the assignment to my satisfaction of similar level.

So instead of wasting your time on searching for them, you will be practicing these instead and saving so much time and energy.</p><p><strong>Keep in mind that with the right training, anyone can improve.</strong></p><p><strong>Wishing you all the best!</strong></p>",

So instead of wasting your time on searching for them, you will be practicing these instead and saving so much time and energy.</p><p><strong>Keep in mind that with the right training, anyone can improve.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Wishing you all the best!</strong></p><p><br></p>",

We will hear terms such as CryptoArt, blockchain, metaverse, NFTs more often and louder in the future. With the expansion of the color palette of the NFT world, the sector is getting more and more valuable and attracts the attention of many giant companies. For this reason, the need for Expert Crypto Artist, NFT designers, 3D modeling experts is increasing day by day on a global scale.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>So what does metaverse mean? What is the connection between 3D NFT and Metaverse technologies?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>NFTs are mostly virtual works of art; consists of music, painting, digital arts, 3D models. It's pretty easy to diversify. 3D modeling has an extremely critical role at the core of these new technologies. With 3D modeling, you can design NFTs, create Metaverse characters, create 3D Assests for virtual plots you buy on Metaverse platforms, and color your own world. Models that you will display exclusively as your own design offer you a technological and cutting-edge opportunity to create virtual value. You can set up your own team with 3D models and NFT and Metaverse characters that you will create with my 3D metaverse and NFT collections design courses. Just focus! A team of software developers and 3D designers can build a 3D metaverse. For this original metaverse, you can create your own NFT exhibit by designing 3D NFTs! The only thing you need for all this; It's a strong start.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The word metaverse is very popular today, when the blockchain technology, which started to develop a long time ago, is at its peak. To simplify this concept, which many of us have heard for the first time; we can call it multiple virtual universes.</p><p><br></p><p>The fact that Metaverse technology brings together institutions and individuals in an online environment modeled and created in 3D represents a bit of teleportation technology. Because this innovation will renew the definition of sociability as everyone is included in the universe by choosing their own unique avatars.</p><p><br></p><p>As we all know, many Mega companies are investing heavily to develop VR glasses. Although it is still not widely used in many countries, this technology will shape the future. Because touch phones, which are owned by almost everyone nowadays, were not a technology that everyone could reach once.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>In summary, what do you need for this course;</strong></p><p><br></p><p>-An ordinary computer.and the Blender 3D program installed on your computer (you can download it for free from the Blender official site.)</p><p><br></p><p><strong>This course will guide you through:</strong></p><p><br></p><p>-3D Modeling</p><p><br></p><p>-3D Design</p><p><br></p><p>-3D Coloring&nbsp; </p><p><br></p><p>Now, if you are ready, let's move on to the most frequently asked questions.</p><p><br></p><p>What is NFT?</p><p><br></p><p>The technology known as NFT, that is, Non-Fungible Token, proves the belonging of a picture, video, the sound or physical entity it represents. In other words, it helps us to own all virtual content. As a matter of fact, this technology is not so new, NFTs, whose foundations were laid in Ethereum in 2017, have become one of the most popular topics in the crypto money industry in 2021.</p><p><br></p><p>After completing this course, you will receive a certificate of attendance for completing the course!</p><p><br></p><p>So what is the difference between NFTs?</p><p><br></p><p>Friends, NFTs cannot be divided, reproduced or repeated. In other words, content produced and sold in this way cannot be thousands like cryptocurrencies. Every NFT is special and therefore carries great meaning. The uniqueness of NFTs makes them much, much more meaningful. For example, cryptocurrencies such as BTC and ETH can be transferred by dividing them into fractions, while NFT is bought and sold alone as a whole.</p><p><br></p><p>So how are NFTs produced?</p><p><br></p><p>As it is known, NFTs are produced according to the ERC-721 token standard prepared by Ethereum developers. NFT trading can be carried out on special platforms established for NFTs by avoiding the intense code complexity of the IT world.</p><p><br></p><p>NFT is a digital asset so you need a digital blockchain wallet for that. For this, the widely used METAMASK wallets can be preferred. We have covered the METAMASK wallet setup in detail in our courses. We invite everyone who does not want to miss the train on NFTs to our platform. After you upload the file you want to print as NFT to the IPFS system via these platforms, you need to provide some information for this NFT. You should write information such as NFT sales price, name, number. Once the transaction is complete, your content is transferred to the relevant wallet and saved on your preferred blockchain network.</p><p><br></p><p>How can I get NFT?</p><p><br></p><p>You can buy and sell NFTs on special platforms prepared for this.</p><p><br></p><p>What are NFT sales types?</p><p><br></p><p>NFTs are usually sold as eth. Some NFT manufacturers sell their NFTs by auction, while others set a direct selling price for the new one.</p><p><br></p><p>In which sectors is NFT used?</p><p><br></p><p>In almost all current technologies, a place is reserved for NFT content. NFTs are sometimes used as a ticket when registering, when logging in, and sometimes as a reward or tool in games. In fact, some NFT communities may impose an obligation to buy NFT as a condition to help each other, so people who want to help by joining the community and get support from people who are more experienced than themselves can pay comfortably for only 1 NFT up to 20 thousand dollars.</p><p><br></p><p>Is NFT an investment?</p><p><br></p><p>I think absolutely yes because in one way or another you are paying for a digital piece of art. You can buy and sell this work on the NFT marketplace. The rarity of the piece in your hand multiplies its value.</p><p><br></p><p>What impact will NFTs have on the Future?</p><p><br></p><p>NFTs are a technology focused on solving the intellectual property problem. As you know, the future is built on the Blockchain network, and we can say that this network is the ground floor of the world of the future. The systems established years ago on this ground now enrich this field by bringing the technology of ownership. Just as there are land sales in METAVERSE technologies, the importance of immutable tokens in this field is proven exponentially day by day.</p><p><br></p><p>With its programmable feature, the first producer of the work on all platforms can determine the royalty fee from each purchase and sale while the work is in circulation. In this way, the fee determined when the sale is made can be transferred directly to the seller's account.</p><p><br></p><p>What are the most notable sales of recent times?</p><p><br></p><p>Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) has sold a collage of his works for $69.4 million at auction by the auction house Christie's. Lebron James' slam dunk video NFT sold for $77,000 via the NBA Top Shot app. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey's tweet was bought by a Turkish person for $2.9 million.</p><p><br></p><p>There are millions of sales transactions like this. The basic stages of NFT projects are quality information, quality content, quality marketing and proper function. It is the quality that sets it apart from the others that pave the way for an NFT to find buyers. This is where we step in. We enable you to gain expertise by teaching you the 3D basics. In this way, you will be able to create quality works with the knowledge and skills you have acquired.</p><p><br></p><p>What will we add to you?</p><p><br></p><p>Our courses will not only give you NFT training but also provide 3D modelling training. In this way, you can easily use it in animation movies, games, NFTs, and Metaverse projects.</p><p><br></p>",

Real estate is a large investment, often requiring a significant part of an and individual\u2019s asset portfolio. Real estate investing often requires financing which increases the complexity. The reason for purchasing real estate varies greatly form person to person, some looking for a long-term home, others looking primarily for an investment, most wanting some mixture of both. Regulations also play a significant role in real estate investing decisions.</p><p>We will include many example problems, both in the format of presentations and Excel worksheet problems. The Excel worksheet presentations will include a downloadable Excel workbook with at least two tabs, one with the answer, the second with a preformatted worksheet that can be completed in a step-by-step process along with the instructional videos.</p><p>This course will start out with the basics. We will discuss basic real estate terms because every specialized field will have terminology we need to understand to communicate well and make decisions.</p><p>Real estate transactions have many components and players involved. Once we understand the basic terminology, we will discuss how those components and players fit together for a real estate transaction to take place.</p><p>Because real estate is a long-term investment, we need to understand time value of money concepts. This course will provide a section explaining what time value of money concepts are and will demonstrate the tools needed to use time value of money concepts. We will learn how to use Excel formulas to calculate present value, future value, payments, and interest rates.</p><p>Learners will understand different financing options. We will apply our time value of money concepts as we create amortization schedules and worksheet to help us analyze different financing options.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong>Recently updated with A LOT of added content.</strong></p><p>Includes downloadable e-book in multiple formats so you can open it on your tablet or Kindle - Formats (EPUB, MOBI, PDF).</p><p>This course is an excellent supplement for students or anybody who wants to learn accounting and also have something they can refer back to in the future. Udemy generally provides lifetime access to the course.</p><p>Many accounting students do not receive a physical book, they get to keep from their school, and even if they did, the information could become dated. Students who want a useful reference tool they can keep, and one that can be more easily updated then a textbook, will benefit from a resource such as this.</p><p>Financial accounting is a LARGE topic and is not something that can be done well in 5, 10, or 20, hours of content, as you may see claimed elsewhere. We will cover accounting theory because theory and concepts are what accounting is. We need to learn theory so we can make appropriate adjustments in the real world. Learning procedures without understanding the theory will make us inflexible and unable to adapt to the ever-changing environment. We will learn the theory while we apply them to procedures.</p><p>Financial accounting is relatively standardized in format. In other words, most accounting institutions will cover much the same topics, often in much the same order. We suggest looking up a standard accounting textbook, checking the index, and comparing the topics to the courses you are considering purchasing. We believe this course will line up well to anybody\u2019s needs who want to learn financial accounting.</p><p>Below is a list of topics by section:</p><p>Section SEC 1 An Introduction to Accounting, The Double Entry Accounting System, &amp; Recording Transactions using Debits and Credits</p><p>Section SEC 2 \u2013 Recording Period End Adjusting Entries</p><p>Section SEC 3 \u2013 Recording Closing Entries</p><p>Section SEC 4 - Merchandising Transactions \u2013 Transactions Involving Inventory</p><p>Section SEC 5 \u2013 Inventory Cost Flow Assumptions (FIFO, LIFO, Weighted Average Methods)</p><p>Section SEC 6 \u2013 Subsidiary Ledgers &amp; Special Journals</p><p>Section SEC 7 \u2013 Bank Reconciliations &amp; Cash Internal Controls</p><p>Section SEC 8 \u2013 Accounts Receivable \u2013 Allowance Method &amp; Direct Write Off Methods</p><p>Section SEC 9 \u2013 Depreciation Methods &amp; Property Plant &amp; Equipment</p><p>Section SEC 10 \u2013 Payroll Accounting</p><p>Section SEC 11 \u2013 Partnership Accounting</p><p>Section SEC 12 \u2013 Accounting for Corporations</p><p>Section SEC 13 \u2013 Bonds Payable, Notes Payable, &amp; Long-Term Liabilities</p><p>Section SEC 14 \u2013 Statement of Cash Flows</p><p>The course will start off at the basics and work all the way through the financial accounting topics generally covered in an undergraduate program.</p><p>First, we will describe what financial accounting is and the objectives of financial accounting. We will learn how the double-entry accounting system works by applying it to the accounting equation. In other words, we will use an accounting equation to record financial transactions using a double-entry accounting system.</p><p>We well learn all topics by fist having presentations and then applying the skills using Excel practice problems. If you are not familiar with how to navigate through Excel, it is OK. We will use preformatted worksheets, have step by step instructional videos, and will start off relatively slow.</p><p>The next step is to apply the double-entry accounting system using debits and credits. Debits and credits are a new concept to most people not familiar with accounting, or possibly worse, many people have misconceptions about the meaning of debit and credit due to its use in areas like bank statements, credit cards, and debit cards.</p><p>We will cover the rules related to debits and credits in a lot of detail. We will then record similar transactions we had done using the accounting equation, but now using debits and credits.</p><p>After we get good at recording transactions using debits and credits, we will learn period end adjusting entries. Adjusting entries are used to adjust the books to represent an accrual basis at the period end better, and they are a great tool for enforcing the concepts of accrual accounting.</p><p>Next, we will use the data we have learned to put together by recording financial transactions into financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. We will learn to construct a statement of cash flows much later in the course.</p><p>After completing the financial statements, we will learn how to journalize and post-closing entries. Closing entries are used to clean out temporary accounts and prepare for the transactions that will be recorded in the next period.</p><p>The steps we have just outlined are critically important to all accounting, and we will need a reasonably good understanding of them to move forward. In other words, the better we understand these concepts, the more natural learning the rest of financial accounting will be. We recommend spending a good deal of time on these concepts and reviewing them often. Think of these skills as a baseball player thinks of playing catch or a musician thinks of playing the basic scales. We should put in some practice with the basics every day.</p><p>Next, we will add inventory to the mix. All the skills we have learned will still apply, but we will now record transactions related to the purchase and sale of inventory.</p><p>We will also learn to track inventory using different methods. We can use specific identification. In other words, we can track the exact unit of inventory that was sold as a car dealership would do. However, companies generally use a cost flow assumption with smaller items that are the same in nature, assumptions like First In Fist Out (FIFO) or Last In Last Out (LIFO). A company may also use a weighted average method.</p><p>Next well will consider subsidiary ledger and special journals. Our main focus is on subsidiary ledger related to accounts receivable and accounts payable. Accounts receivable represents money owed to the organization.</p><p>The general ledger will provide the transactions that make up the accounts receivable account balance by date. However, we will want to see this data reported by customers, so we know who owes the company money and how much, and this is the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger.</p><p>We have a similar situation with accounts payable. Accounts payable represent vendors the company owes money to. We will want to sort this information by vendors, so we know which vendors we owe money to and how much.</p><p>Next, we will cover bank reconciliation and internal controls related to cash. The bank reconciliation is one of the most important internal controls outside of the double-entry accounting system itself. All businesses, large and small, should perform a bank reconciliation. The bank reconciliation will reconcile the cash balance on the company\u2019s books to the cash balance reported by the bank as of a specific date, the date of the bank statement, typically the end of the month.</p><p>The bank statement balance will not agree to the book balance due to outstanding items, items recorded by the company, but which have not yet cleared the bank. The outstanding items will be the reconciling items in a bank reconciliation.</p><p>Next will learn how to value accounts receivable and deal with those accounts we will not be able to collect on. In other words, accounts receivable represent money owed to the business for work done in the past. However, some of those receivables may not ever be paid. How do we account for the a customers we do not think will pay and how do we value the accounts receivable account if we believe some of the receivable will may not be collected in the future, but we do not know which ones?</p><p>GAAP generally requires the use of what is called the allowance method to value accounts receivable. We will compare the allowance method to the direct write off method, an easier method but one that does not conform to accrual accounting as well.</p><p>Next, we will cover property plant and equipment. The most difficult concept related to property plant and equipment is calculating and recording depreciation. Deprecation can be calculated using different methods, including the straight-line method, the double-declining balance method, and the units of production method. We will compare and contrast each method in detail.</p><p>We will also consider how to record the purchase and sale of property plant and equipment.</p><p>Next, we will discuss the tracking and reporting of payroll. Payroll is a very large topic because of the payroll laws included in it. We will discuss how to calculate payroll taxes, including federal income tax FIT, social security, and Medicare. We will record journal entries related to payroll. Payroll journal entries are some of the longest and most complex journal entries recorded in the standard accounting cycle.</p><p>Next, we will learn partnership accounting. The concepts we learned related to the double-entry accounting system will apply to partnerships. Our focus now will be on those transactions unique to a partnership form of entity. For example, we will discuss how to allocate net income to each partners capital account. A partnership type of entity is very flexible, and there are many different ways partners can agree on to allocate income.</p><p>We will discuss how to record transactions when a new partner is added to a partnership or when an existing partner leaves a partnership.</p><p>We will also cover how to record the liquidation of a partnership. Much of the liquidation process will apply to the closing of other business entity types as well. However, the partnership type of entity has the added difficulty of allocating the final proceeds to the partners in accordance with their capital accounts.</p><p>Then we will consider transaction unique to a corporation format of entity. Like the partnership form of entity, the corporation will use the same double-entry accounting system we learned at the beginning of the course. In this section, we will learn how to record the sale of capital stock and the sale of preferred stock. We will record transaction related to the purchase of treasury stock. We will discuss how to record cash dividends and stock dividends.</p><p>Then we will learn concepts related to bonds payable, notes payable, and long term liabilities. Many people are familiar with bonds as a type of investment. We will consider bonds from the other side of the transaction with the issuance of bonds. Bonds are often used as a tool to understand the time-value of money concept and interest rates at a deeper level. Therefore, even if you do not plan on recording many transactions related to the issuance of bonds, it is a useful process to learn valuable concepts. Bonds are often issued at a premium or a discount. The premium or discount is then amortized over the life of the bond.</p><p>We will discuss how to record the initial sale of the bond. We will talk about how to amortize the bond discount and premium. We will record transactions related to bond interest, and we will discuss transactions for the dissolution of the bonds.</p><p>The course will also cover the recording of notes payable. One of the most complex components of notes payable is the breaking out of interest and principal portion of the payment. For the task of breaking out interest and principal, we will need an amortization schedule. We will build amortization schedules from scratch, a useful skill to understand.</p><p>The second complication with notes payable is breaking out the current and long term portion of the note. We will use the amortization schedule to perform the task of calculating the current and long term portion of the notes payable.</p><p>Finally, we will discuss how to create a statement of cash flows. The statement of cash flows is on the of primary financial statements along with the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity, but the statement of cash flows can be more complicated to construct.</p><p>The statement of cash flows represents the flow of cash broken out into three categories, operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. We have constructed the financial statements using an accrual basis rather than a cash basis. We can think of the statement of cash flows as converting the accrual basis to a cash basis.</p><p>We can use two methods when constructing the operating section of the statement of cash flows, the direct method, and the indirect method. The indirect method is more common and often required, even if we also add the direct method. The indirect method starts with net income in then backs into cash flow from operations.</p><p><strong>Sample of part to test in the book that comes with the course: </strong></p><p>The first questions asked when introduced to any new topic are often:</p><p>\u2022 What is it?</p><p>\u2022 Why do I need to know it?</p><p>We will address the second question first: why do I need to know accounting?</p><p>Answer: Because it\u2019s fun. Because accounting is fun is likely not the first thing that popped into your mind, but we want to start off with this concept, the idea of thinking of accounting as a kind of game, a sort of puzzle, something we can figure out. Thinking of accounting as a game will make learning accounting much more enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Accounting </strong>can be defined as an \u201cinformation and measurement system that identifies, records, and communicates relevant information about a company\u2019s business activities\u201d<strong> </strong>(John J. Wild, 2015).</p><p>The process of accounting includes the accumulation of data into a relevant form, which can be used for practical decision making.</p><p>Data is often identified using forms and documents such as bills, invoices, and timesheets. Once identified information is input into an accounting system, often an electronic one. The end goal of financial accounting is the creation of financial statements including a balance sheet, income statement, and statement of equity. The financial statements are used to make relevant decisions.</p><p>There are many reasons to learn accounting concepts, other than it being fun, although we always want to keep the fun factor in mind. Some of the most obvious reasons for learning accounting include:</p><p>\u00b7 Accounting provides a format to understand business whether we are in the accounting department or not. Accounting is the language of business, a way of communicating business objectives and performance. All areas and departments benefit from understanding accounting because it provides a way to communicate between departments and communication is critical to business success.</p><p>\u00b7 Accounting concepts apply to our personal finances. We all need to deal with our personal finances and learning basic accounting concepts and recording techniques helps ease our mind when dealing with our financial tasks.</p><p>Other reasons for learning accounting, which are not so obvious, include that accounting is a great tool to help develop critical thinking skills. Accounting requires reasoning to work through problems, and the practice of accounting will refine reasoning abilities and help us approach problems in a more systematic way, a more efficient way.</p><p>Accounting can also provide the same sense of satisfaction we receive when completing a puzzle, when mastering a new musical pattern, or when playing a game skillfully. Accounting can provide the same shot of dopamine when we figure out a problem, discern how something works and can claim that the double entry accounting system is in balance.</p><p><strong>Accounting can be compared to a game of checkers</strong></p><p>For example, the game of checkers starts with setting up pieces on a board, a spreadsheet, following a set of rules. To set up the board, we need to have memorized the rules for doing so. Memorizing rules is not the fun aspect of checkers but is a necessary one to receiving the enjoyment of playing the game. Once the board is set up the game of checkers is played by moving pieces according to a set of rules to achieve a certain objective, the elimination of opponent\u2019s pieces.</p><p>Accounting is similar in that we will start off by learning how to set up the board, the accounting board being a T account or ledger. As with checkers, we will need to memorize where the pieces fit on the board, which side of the T account pieces will line up on. Accounting pieces are the accounts and account types which have a normal balance lining up on the left or right side of the board, of the T account or ledger.</p><p>Once we know the normal balance of accounts, we will play the accounting game by applying debits and credits to the accounts following a set of rules which have a particular objective, the creation of relevant information, the creation of financial statements.</p><p><strong>The major obstacles for learning accounting are the same as those for learning music.</strong></p><p>The primary obstacle to learning accounting concepts is the memorization of rules, a simple task, but one most do not find very enjoyable.</p><p>Memorizing rules is the same obstacle holding people back from learning many fulfilling activities, activities like learning music, or a new language. Rules of some kind must be learned to play music. The idea of rules, of structure, of constraints, seems counter-intuitive to the concept of creativity we associate with creating and playing music, but rules, structure, and limitations are often requirements for creativity. For example, writing and especially poetry, requires adherence to strict rules and many great writers have done their best work while constrained by deadlines and editors.</p><p>Whether it be notes, chords, or songs rote memorization is required before these learned concepts can be used to create something new, to create or play music, the structure critically contributing to the creation process. Creating, of course, is the fun part, the fulfilling part, the area to look forward to but memorization is a necessary part, a critical part, and a part well worth the effort.</p><p><strong>Confidence in the system is required to learn accounting</strong></p><p>Education is all about asking questions, testing theories, and being skeptical of claims given without a convincing argument, without supporting facts. Accounting is no different. Questioning is essential to setting up an efficient accounting system, but the tradition of questioning can also be used as a crutch, as an excuse for not moving forward and finding our mistakes.</p><p>I recommend accounting students start out having faith that the double entry accounting system works, in a similar way that we have faith that a 1,000 piece puzzle will contain all the pieces required and can be constructed to match the picture on box, because without this confidence we will lose the motivation to move forward, to complete the task, and therefore miss out on the enjoyment of completing the project.</p><p>Confidence in the double entry accounting system is necessary when first learning accounting concepts because doubting the system restricts us from moving forward to complete the necessary steps and look for the mistakes we have made. It is much easier to claim that the system does not work then look for the more likely problem, our own errors.</p><p>Having faith in a system does not mean we should not question a system. Questions are always encouraged, at all times, but it is best to give the concepts the benefit of the doubt and not allow our questioning of the system to be an excuse, a crutch, for not completing a task or figuring out a problem.</p><p>The double entry accounting system has been around for a long time, at least since the Franciscan monk Luca Pacioli around 1494, and while this does not prove its correctness it does show that it has been a useful tool to many in the past, and will therefore likely be a useful tool to many in the future.</p><p>Accounting is divided into two major groups; Financial Accounting &amp; Managerial Accounting.</p><p><strong>Financial accounting </strong>has the end goal of generating financial statements, financial statements designed with external user needs in mind. The aim of financial accounting toward external users may seem strange at first because financial data is required and used for internal, managerial, decision making as well but external users have needs that require more reliance on financial statements in many ways.</p><p><strong>External users</strong> are users outside the company and include investors, creditors, the internal revenues service, and customers. Companies need these external users for things such as investments, loans, and to follow laws and regulations.</p><p>External users do not have intimate knowledge of the business and therefore need assurance to increase the level of trust, trust being a necessary component for business transactions to take place. To increase confidence levels, financial statements are required to follow a strict format of rules designed to standardize the financial reporting. Standardization allows for the comparison of financial information across time and between different companies.</p><p><strong>Managerial accounting</strong> has the goal of generating relevant information for internal decision makers to make sound decisions, for management.</p><p>Managerial accounting does include the use of the same financial information generated in financial accounting, but information is not required to be in a particular format, managerial accounting being less regulated. Management has intimate knowledge of the company, and therefore there is less need for regulations on the format of data and information. Management will determine the best format for managerial statements to assist in making the best decisions.</p><p>Because managerial accounting is less regulated, it is commonly thought that managerial accounting will differ greatly from organization to organization. While it is true that managerial accounting practices will vary from company to company, there are also best practices which are applied, practices that have stood the test of time, those that have helped good companies be great. The study of managerial accounting is the study of best practices used to make good business decisions.</p><p>Financial accounting developed in much the same way, businesses looking for best practices to compile data for both themselves and external users. Over time financial accounting has solidified those best practices into a standardized form. Standardization often limits innovation but does provide a clear format for external users, this being one of the tradeoffs related to regulation. We will talk more about the need for standardization in a profession like accounting when we discuss what a profession is and the need for ethics and regulations within a profession.</p><p>Ethics plays a huge role in accounting as it does in most professions, in part, because ethics deals with trust and trust is an essential component of any business transaction. The concept of ethics is very broad, has been studied intensely since ancient times, and is an area which still has many open questions, but ethics related to accounting can be narrowed from the broader discussion in some ways.</p><p>One way to think of ethics as it relates to a profession is by implementing a kind of categorical imperative, acting in a way that we would wish to be universal for the entire profession. For example, stealing could benefit an individual but if everyone steals everyone is worse off and therefore stealing would be wrong.</p><p>Similarly acting in a way that is misleading could lead to gains for an individual but doing so harms the profession and is therefore wrong. Most professions can apply a concept like this. two of the oldest professions are law and medicine. The reason professions are needed in areas like law, medicine, and accounting is because they deal with specialized knowledge, knowledge most people do not have and that many are dependent on at some point in their lives. An uneven distribution of knowledge can cause incentives for individuals to seek short term gains through deceit.</p><p>For example, somebody claiming to know medicine could administer medicine that is not effective and the patient would not know, a patient having no choice but to trust the expertise of the doctor. If a physician abuses trust by administering remedies that are not effective, they are profiting off the name of the profession, from the brand of the occupation, and if this practice is done enough, it will result in a lack of trust in medicine.</p><p>A similar scenario can be painted for many areas of accounting, accounting having advanced to a specialized field, one that most do not understand, but are forced to deal in at some point or another. The need for trust drives and incentivizes a profession to self-regulate, to build a brand. One way the accounting profession self-regulates is by requiring different certifications to practice in different areas, certifications like a certified public accountant CPA license. A certification process helps provide the public with a level of trust that an individual has some basic understanding of concepts they are dealing with and provides ethical standards that must be met.</p><p>An example of the need for trust in accounting is when investors use financial statements to make investment decisions. Publicly traded stocks have an increased need for transparency in their financial reporting because their stock is being sold and traded by the public, a huge benefit to both companies and investors, providing capital to companies, and opportunities for gain to investors.</p><p>For an individual to invest, however, they need to analyze their options, and financial statements are the primary tool for this analysis. If investors do not have confidence in the numbers reported on the financial statements, do not understand how the numbers are reported, or cannot compare the numbers to related companies, investment transactions will decline due to a lack of information and trust.</p><p>The economy needs trust in the system as a major component which keeps interactions taking place, compelling people to take calculated risks, driving individuals to do business and drive growth and innovation.</p><p>Fraud is one component in the discussion of ethics, fraud being the deliberate attempt to deceive for personal gain. Fraud can take many forms in business from theft to falsifying the financial statements to drive up stock prices and increase bonus pay.</p><p>Most people believe fraud is all about employing the right people, honest people, those with integrity. While the right people is a huge component, it is not the only one. Good people in a bad environment or culture can fall victim to the group mentality. Businesses can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing conditions that foster fraud and taking active steps in reducing them.</p><p>A criminologist has introduced the idea of a <strong>fraud triangle</strong>, consisting of three factors which increase the likelihood of fraud. <strong>Fraud factors</strong> include <strong>opportunity</strong>, <strong>pressure</strong>, and <strong>rationalization</strong>.</p><p><strong>Opportunity</strong> means that the ability to commit fraud and not be caught is present, or at least perceived. For example, if a company had a policy of keeping their petty cash fund in a shoebox in the middle of the lunch room the opportunity for theft without detection would be greater than if the money was put into a more secure location.</p><p><strong>Pressure</strong> or incentive means that a person is under pressure of some kind, often financial. If money if tight the likelihood of an individual committing fraud is significantly increased.</p><p><strong>Rationalization </strong>is when a person justifies an action. Our minds are excellent at rationalizing. We generally believe that we think before acting, but we often act and then justify the action through rationalization. Rationalization is one reason fraud tends to continue, and even escalate over time.</p><p>For example, if a company left the petty cash in the lunchroom an employee may rationalize theft by reasoning that it\u2019s the company\u2019s fault for not better safeguarding their assets. While it may be true that leaving cash in the middle of the lunchroom is not a good internal control for a company, it is not a justification for theft. Another common rationalization is that a company is vast and rich while an employee may feel small and poor and taking to from the rich to give to the poor is not bad. Again, there may be some truth to this statement, but it is not a reason justifying theft.</p><p>Companies can reduce the likelihood of fraud by recognizing these fraud factors and taking active steps to reduce them, steps including internal controls. For example, companies should safeguard assets and should create a culture of honesty, communication, and respect, a culture that needs to be demonstrated from the top down. If the culture is bad at the top good employees will not be able to pull up the culture from the bottom.</p><p><strong>Objectivity \u2013 </strong>To provide information useful to investors creditors, and others. The concept of objectivity seems obvious, but we always need to keep the end goal in mind, the creation of useful information for external users. Financial accounting is aimed at producing useful information for external users like investors, creditors, and customers, the format of this information usually being financial statements. By anticipating the needs of external users, we can set rules and guidelines to provide the most value.</p><p><strong>Qualitative Characteristics</strong> \u2013 To require information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable. The characteristics of relevance, reliability, and comparability are related to the objective of providing useful information because external users will value these features.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Relevant</strong> means the information is relevant or necessary to the needs of the users. Relevant information could be information that influences the decision-making process. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements to assess the likelihood of a business\u2019s ability to pay the loan back in the future.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Reliable</strong> means that the information must be trusted or must be believed that it is free of material errors and is presented in a fair way. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may request financial statements and want assurance that they can be trusted. Part of the assurance requirement may be that the financial statements are presented in a standardized form, following a standardized set of rules. A bank may also ask for a third-party review or audit to add to the level of reliability.</p><p>\u00b7 <strong>Comparability </strong>means that financial information needs to be comparable to prior periods and other companies. Comparability requires standardization, a systematic way of compiling data from one time to the next. For example, a bank deciding whether to make a loan to a business may want to compare financial</p><p>statement performance with prior years to see if there has been an improvement and to compare financial statements to other businesses in the industry. For comparisons of financial statements to be relevant, there needs to be conformity in presentation.</p><p><strong>Going-concern assumption - </strong>the presumption that the business will continue operating instead of being closed. We assume a business is in business to stay in business, to have an objective of revenue generation and growth. If a business is planning on stopping business or is going bankrupt their behavior is likely to be much different than if they planned on continuing business. A business that is not a going concern, one that plans on stopping operations, needs to disclose this information to the readers of their financial statements so that readers can change their default assumption that the business will remain in business.</p><p><strong>Separate business entity assumption -</strong> means that the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction. Every transaction will have a reason and we need to determine if the reason is business or personal in nature.</p><p>The business objective is revenue generation. A business\u2019s mission statement will define what a business does to generate revenue, but from an accounting standpoint, the objective of revenue generation will help guide business actions and help us categorize transactions as either business or personal.</p><p>Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the business accounting will be kept separate from personal accounting and that of other businesses. Separating business accounting and personal accounting is clear conceptually, the separation providing more relevant information for making business decisions, but can be difficult in practice. The driving concept for deciding whether an accounting transaction is business or personal is the objective behind the transaction, the reason for the transaction. Every transaction will have a reason and we need to determine if the reason is business or personal in nature.</p><p>The business objective is revenue generation. A business\u2019s mission statement will define what a business does to generate revenue, but from an accounting standpoint, the objective of revenue generation will help guide business actions and help us categorize transactions as either business or personal.</p><p>Personal objectives may include a goal of being happy or living well. Personal objectives will vary from person to person, and for more detail on personal objectives we would need to consult the study of philosophy, a topic for another time, but the objective of living well will suit our needs. If the driving reason for a transaction is to be happy or to live well, rather than the more specific objective of revenue generation, the transaction is a personal one.</p><p>An example of separating business and personal objectives is the creation of a separate business checking account, a separate account allowing us to track the business revenue and expenditures more quickly, most deposits into the business checking account being revenue and most withdrawals being expenses.</p><p>The difference between a business expense and a personal expense is the objective for the expense. For example, if we went out to dinner the cost of the meal may be business or personal depending on the objective. If we took clients to dinner to pick up new business engagements, the meal would be a business expense and if we took our family out to dinner to have fun and live well it would be a personal expense.</p><p>In a similar way as expenses can be either business or personal, assets can also be either business or personal in nature. For example, if we purchase a building with the intention of making widgets for sale the building would be an asset rather than an expense because it will help generate revenue in the future and has not yet been consumed. On the other hand, if we purchase a building to live in as a home it would be a personal asset, the objective being to live well.</p><p>We can think of many areas where business and personal objectives overlap, areas were categorizing the transaction is difficult. For example, we may take both family and clients to dinner or we may work from our home. As accountants, our job is to differentiate the business and personal portion as much as possible to better measure our performance.</p><p>Our business objectives can be thought of as fitting inside our larger personal objectives, the generation of revenue being part of our larger personal goals of living well.</p><p>As the business grows and achieves the business objective of revenue generation owners can begin taking money and resources out of the business to be used for their larger personal objectives of living well.</p><p>\u201cGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) are uniform minimum standards of, and guidelines to, financial accounting and reporting. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) are authorized to establish these principles.\u201d (AICPA, n.d.)</p><p>Financial Accounting strives to generate financial information that is relevant, reliable, and comparable because these characteristics create value to users of financial reports, particularly to external users of financial reports.</p><p>Creating and implementing standard guidelines for the processing and reporting of financial statements makes the financial statements more relevant, reliable, and comparable. Standards help to standardize financial reporting, making financial statements comparable across time and to other companies.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has authority to set Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP and the SEC has delegated much of the responsibilities of setting GAAP to the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB. The SEC is a governmental agency, and the FASB is a private sector group. The system of delegating authority to a private sector group makes sense because the accounting profession, like any profession, has an incentive to self-regulate and has a better understanding of the problems within the profession and how best to address them.</p><p>There are many useful ways to separate and categorize business entities, one being by business form, by type of business structure; another being by a business's relation to inventory, whether the business is selling inventory and whether they produce the inventory they are selling.</p><p>The three broad categories of business structure are a sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.</p><p>A <strong>sole proprietorship</strong> is a business owned by one person and is the most common type of business in the United States. The benefits of a sole proprietorship are that they are easy and inexpensive to form. An individual who starts acting as a business, generating revenue, is a sole proprietor by default unless they create some other type of organizations. The income from a sole proprietor is taxable but will be reported on the individual tax return, on Form 1040 supported by a supplemental Schedule C.</p><p>The disadvantages of a sole proprietor include limited personal liability protection and limited capital generation capability when compared to other types of organizations.</p><p>A <strong>partnership</strong> is similar to a sole proprietor except that the business now has two or more partners. A partnership has the same benefit of easy formation and the same drawbacks of liability exposure and limited capital generation.</p><p>A <strong>corporation</strong> is a separate legal entity. Corporations are less common than the sole proprietorship but generate the largest percentage of total U.S. revenue. The benefits of a corporation include that they provide liability protection through being a separate legal entity, the theory being that the assets of the corporation are liable but personal assets are not, personal assets having more protection when compared to other types of organizations. The disadvantages of a corporation include that they are more costly to form, more complicated to maintain, and can result in double taxation.</p><p>Much more can be said about types of entities, but this will provide a starting point. From an accounting perspective, we will start out with transactions related to a sole proprietorship and then move to a partnership and then a corporation. The reason for starting with the sole proprietorship is that it is a business form that most people can relate to and because many of the transactions found in a sole proprietorship will be the same for all entity types.</p><p>We will then move to a partnership, concentrating on the areas that are different from a sole proprietorship. Many of the transactions and processes will be the same, both entities needing to record the paying of the rent, employees, and utilities, both entities recording revenue. Transactions will differ, however, in the equity section because a partnership will have two or more owners, so the equity section is where we will spend much of our time.</p><p>We will then move to a corporation, concentrating on the areas that are different. Many transactions will remain the same, but the equity section is one area that will differ, the owners now being stockholders.</p><p>Another useful way to categorize businesses is by industry or by whether they use inventory and whether they produce inventory. A service company does not sell inventory, a merchandising business purchases and sells inventory, and a manufacturing business produces inventory to sell.</p><p>A company\u2019s relationship with inventory has a significant impact on many accounting transactions and reporting. We will start out with a service company, using similar logic as we did when starting out with a sole proprietorship. Service companies have many of the same transactions as companies that deal with inventory, but they do not need to track inventory. We will then move to merchandising companies, companies that buy and sell inventory, adding the items that are different, items related to inventory. We will then move to a manufacturing companies, companies that produces inventory, adding things that differ, the tracking of inventory from raw materials to work in process and then to finished goods.</p><p>Generally Accepted Accounting Principle GAAP will be based on accrual concepts. The accrual basis can be compared and contrasted to a cash basis, the cash basis being a simplified method, one which does not provide information as useful, as relevant, or as accurate as an accrual method.</p><p><strong>Cash basis</strong> \u2013 Records revenue when cash is received and expenses when cash is paid. A cash basis is not the basis required by GAAP, GAAP rules following an accrual basis, but understanding a cash basis helps in understanding both how an accrual basis works and the reasons for it. Cash and revenue are not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when revenue will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash collection does not always equal the exact location in time of revenue earnings but is often close enough.</p><p>In a similar way as revenue being recorded when cash is received under a cash basis, expenses are recorded when cash is paid under a cash basis. Cash and expenses are also not the same things, as we will see when we record transactions, but a cash basis uses cash as an indicator of when expenses will be recorded. The concept of a cash basis is like a firefighter following the smoke to get to a fire, the smoke not pinpointing the exact location but being close enough. Cash payment does not always equal the exact location in time expenses were incurred but is often close enough.</p><p>Very few businesses use a pure cash basis because there are times when the smoke is not close to the fire, times when revenue is not close to cash collection, and times when expense incursion is not close to cash payment. For example, almost any business would recognize a cash payment of $100,000 for a building as an asset of a building rather than an expense of building expense even though cash is paid. The reason a building is recorded as an asset is that the asset has not yet been consumed, has not yet been used to generate revenue.</p><p><strong>Accrual basis</strong> \u2013 is driven by two main principles, the revenue recognition principle and the matching principle. Revenue recognition deals with the time to recognize revenue and the matching principle deals with the time to record expenses.</p><p>The revenue recognition principle records revenue when the revenue is earned, a time which is not always the same as when revenue is paid. Finding the exact time that revenue has been earned is not always easy but is usually when the job has been completed. For example, the time when revenue has been earned for a service company is when the job has been completed, when the service is done, and the time when revenue has been earned for a merchandising company is when inventory is delivered to the customer. An accrual method is closer to a firefighter using a GPS system to pinpoint the exact location of a fire rather than just estimating the location by following the smoke.</p><p>For example, a food truck may have a policy of only accepting cash for food. The policy of accepting cash as the only form of payment means the time cash is received and the time work is done will be the same. Therefore, both a cash method and an accrual method will result in the same journal entry but for different reasons, the cash method being driven by the cash received, the accrual method being driven by the earnings of the income, by the delivery of the food.</p><p>A bookkeeping business, on the other hand, will often need to perform work, invoice the client on completion of the work, expecting a check in the mail sometime in the future. The revenue recognition principle would require revenue to be recognized at the time the work was done, often when the invoice was generated and not when cash was received. We will cover the format of these transactions a little later but for now, recognize that revenue is the act of earning revenue which is different from receiving cash, cash usually being the form of payment for revenue earned. There are other forms of payment, including trade or barter, but cash is the most common form of payment. The revenue recognition principle is similar to how most of us think of our paychecks when working for a company. A business may pay employees every other week, but an employee has earned the revenue in the week the work was done. The company is expected to pay the employee for work done even if the employee leaves the company. For example, if an employee earned wages of $1,000 last week according to their employment agreement and employment is terminated this week the employee will still expect payment of $1,000 for the work performed last week, for revenue that was earned by the employee last week even though cash had not yet been received.</p><p>It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received. For example, a newspaper company will collect money before doing the work, before delivering newspapers. A newspaper company will often collect money for a year\u2019s subscription and then earn the revenue by delivering the newspapers in the future. Under an accrual method the newspaper company will have to wait on recording revenue until they earn the revenue by doing work, by delivering the papers, even though they already have the cash in hand. Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those </p><p>Click Here</p><p><br></p><p>It is possible, but less common, to receive cash before work is performed, revenue still being recorded at the time work is done under an accrual basis rather than the time payment is received.

Even though the company has the cash related to future sales they have not earned the revenue for those future sales and if they do not deliver the newspapers in the future they will owe the money back.</p><p>As mentioned earlier there are many ways the double entry accounting system can be expressed including the use of an accounting equation, debits and credits, and a balance sheet. We will focus on the accounting equations in this section. The benefits of an accounting equation include the use of a simple formula, simple math that can be explained and understood. Transactions will be described using the symmetry of the accounting equation. The problem with using the accounting equation to record transactions and build the financial statements is that it is not as efficient as the use of debits and credits. We will learn the balancing concept using the accounting equation, but as we do, keep in mind that the accounting equation is not the whole story, that we will need to understand new concepts, the concepts of debits and credits, to record data with which to generate financial statements well.</p><p>The accounting equation is:</p><p><strong>Asset = Liabilities + Equity</strong></p><p>The format above is the most common form of the accounting equation for financial accounting because the left side of the equation shows what the business owns and the right side shows who it is owed to, either a third-party liability or the owner. Recall our separate business entity assumption while considering the accounting equation. Thinking of the business as a separate entity helps to understand the accounting equation, the left side of the equal sign showing what the separate entity owns, the right showing who has claim to what the separate entity owns.</p><p>Because the accounting equation is a formula it can be expressed at least two other ways. A second way to write the equation is:</p><p><strong>Assets \u2013 Liabilities = Equity</strong></p><p>The format of the accounting equation above is useful because it emphasizes that equity is the book value of the company, the amount left over after subtracting liabilities from assets, an amount which can also be called net assets. To understand the meaning of equity we can consider the liquidation of a company, the selling of assets for cash, the payment of liabilities owed, and the leftover cash which would then be available to the owner, this amount being equal to equity if assets were sold at book value. Note that all assets will not be sold for the exact amount reported when a business is sold. For example, an asset of equipment valued at $50,000 may not be sold for $50,000 in a free market, possibly being sold for something less like $40,000 or something more like $60,000. We will discuss this more at a later time. For now, remember that equity represents net assets on a book value basis, assets minus liabilities. </p><p>A third way to write the accounting equation is:</p><p><strong>Assets \u2013 Equity = Liabilities</strong></p><p>This format of the accounting equation is not as useful but is another way the accounting equation can be expressed algebraically.</p><p>Account types include assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses. Recognize that account types are not the same thing as actual accounts, each account type having multiple accounts falling into the category. Understanding account types and the accounts that fall into each account type category is essential to the accounting process.</p><p><strong>Assets</strong> are resources owned by the business. The most common asset is cash, but assets also include accounts receivable, prepayments, land, building, and equipment. Assets are items that have not yet been consumed, resources planned to be used in the future to achieve business goals, to help generate revenue.</p><p><strong>Liabilities</strong> are claims by creditors. Liabilities come about from a transaction that happens in the past which obligates the company for some form of future payment. Purchasing something on a credit card is an example of how a liability can be created, the transaction creating a future obligation to pay cash. Liability accounts include accounts payable, notes payable, and bonds payable.</p><p><strong>Equity</strong> is the owner\u2019s claim to assets. Equity is equal to assets minus liabilities. Equity is often the most confusing section of the accounting equation, in part, because different organization types will organize the equity section differently and because the equity section is involved in the closing process of temporary accounts.</p><p>The equity section represents what is owed to the owner on a book basis. This is best illustrated by imagining we liquidate or close a business, selling the assets for cash, and then paying off the liabilities. The money left over would be equal to the equity section if all sales were made on a book value basis.</p><p>The equity section for a sole proprietor will be called owner\u2019s equity and consist of one capital account. The equity section of a partnership will be called partnership equity and consist of two or more owners and therefore two or more capital accounts. The equity section of a corporation will be called shareholder\u2019s equity, shareholders being the owners of a corporation, and will included capital stock and retained earnings. Although the format changes the equity section taken as a whole can still be thought of as what is owed to the owner or owners in each case.</p><p>When thinking about the accounting equation, the equity section includes all temporary accounts, including revenue accounts and expense accounts.</p><p><strong>Revenue - </strong>is income generated from performing work. Revenue is not the same thing as cash. Cash is a form of payment while revenue represents the creation of value and the earning of compensation. Revenue is a timing account, needing to be measured over a time frame, a starting and ending point. For example, when somebody says they earn $100,000 the concept has no meaning unless we assign a time frame, most people naturally attributing a year as the time frame when hearing a number like $100,000. A different time frame would have a much different meaning. For example, revenue of $100,000 a month is much different than revenue of $100,000 a year.</p><p>We can contrast temporary accounts, like revenue and expense accounts, with permanent accounts like cash. Saying we have $100,000 cash does not require a time frame to define what we mean because cash is a permanent account, representing a position at a point in time.</p><p><strong>Expense</strong> is the using of assets or incurrence of liabilities as part of operations to generate revenue. Expenses are what a business needs to consume to achieve the goal of revenue generation. Expenses are also temporary accounts needing a beginning and ending time.</p><p>There are usually many more expense accounts then revenue accounts, but we hope the revenue accounts add up to a greater dollar amount. The reason there are more expense accounts then revenue accounts is because of specialization, companies focusing on earning money by doing what they do best and paying for their other needs.</p><p>Before we demonstrate common transactions and how they are analyzed using the accounting equating we will cover transaction rules. Applying a process for recording transactions will reduce the likelihood of making bad assumptions and learning rules that do not apply in all cases.</p><p>It is possible to learn rules that apply in only some cases, requiring the unlearning of these rules when we move to cases where they do not apply. Learning rules that do not apply in all cases should be avoided because unlearning rules in cases where a bad rule does not apply is tough.</p><p>Learning and applying the steps below for recording transactions helps avoid problems, eliminating the need to unlearn false concepts in the future. These same rules will apply when we move to learning debits and credits at which time we will build on these rules, applying more concepts to the balancing ideas developed here.</p><p><strong>Transaction Rules:</strong></p><p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Every transaction will affect at least two accounts.</p><p>\u00b7 Every transaction will keep the accounting equation in balance.</p><p>Transaction thought process</p><p>When first learning transactions we will repeat this thought process for each transaction, the thought process being designed to make the recording of transactions as easy as possible, and avoid learning rules that are not always applicable. This process will make more sense as we work through transactions. Working transactions is the only way to understand the double entry accounting system fully.</p><p>We will now go through common financial transactions, transactions needed by most any business, and analyze them using the accounting equation and our set of rules and thought processes.</p><p>We will start off looking at transactions involving cash, cash being the most common account affected. Understanding how cash is affected will act like an add, or crutch, when considering the other account or accounts effected in the transaction.</p><p>First, imagine a situation where the cash goes up because the company received cash, and consider possibilities for the other account affected.</p><p>We know that at least one other account will be effect and that the accounting equation must remain in balance. If there is only one other account effected we are left with just three possibilities to keep the accounting equation in balance. Either the liabilities went up, equity went up, or another asset account also went down. Below are examples of each.</p><p>If cash went up because of a business receiving a bank loan, then liabilities would also go up, keeping the accounting equation in balance.</p><p>If cash went goes up do to collecting cash for work the company did then revenue or income would also go up, revenue being part of equity.</p><p>If cash went up because we are receiving money for work done in the past we would also reduce the accounts receivable account, an asset account representing money owed to the company for past work completed.</p><p>It is possible to use an expanded accounting equation, listing all accounts under each account type, forming a kind of trial balance which can be used to create the financial statements. We will not be using this format here because it is not an efficient way to generate financial statements and gives the impression that debits and credits are not needed, which is not a good impression to give.</p><p>To understand double entry accounting and how financial statements are created, the accounting equation is not sufficient, and debits and credit will be needed. We will introduce how debits and credits work later, but the concepts will build on the concepts we learn here working with the accounting equation.</p><p>Below are more common transaction and the effect on the accounting equation:</p><p><strong>Owner invests cash into the business:</strong></p><p>The asset account of cash goes up as well as equity, the amount owed to the owner. Equity goes up because the business basically owes the cash back to the owner. When investing cash into a business, an owner is hoping to receive a return on investment and be able to withdraw cash from the business in the future, to be used for personal use.</p><p><strong>Purchase of supplies for cash:</strong></p><p>The asset of cash goes down, but another asset of supplies goes up, the net result being no change in any account type of the account equation. The result of a transaction with no change to the accounting equation is one reason debits and credits are a more efficient way to record transactions then the use of the accounting equation. We will record much the same transaction using debits and credits later.</p><p>The increase in supplies is an increase in an asset type account rather than an expense type account, expenses being part of equity, because of the accrual accounting principle of matching. When the supplies are purchased, they have not yet been used to help generate revenue but will help to generate revenue in the future. Supplies will be expensed in the time they are used or consumed to help generate revenue.</p><p>Supplies will be our introduction to an inventory system because supplies will be tracked in a similar way as inventory. The recording of supplies will start with reporting supplies as an asset, followed by the counting of supplies at end of a time period, like a month, to determine how much has been used, and then the recording of the decrease is the supplies asset account and recording of the supplies utilized in the supplies expense account.</p><p>Supplies may be expenses when purchased if the amount is not material, not significant to decision making, because expensing the supplies is an easier process than capitalizing as an asset when the amount is not significant to decision making. For example, if we purchased two years\u2019 worth of paper-clips for $100 we may just expense the purchase because the cost of $100 is not significant to decision making, $100 not being an amount that will impact financial statement user choices.</p><p><strong>Purchase Supplies on Account \u2013 No Cash:</strong></p><p>Because no cash is effected, we will first consider what is received, that being supplies in this case. The asset account of supplies will go up, and the liability account of accounts payable will go up. The accounts payable account is like a credit card account, going up when we purchase on account and going down when we pay off the balance owed.</p><p><strong>Pay Cash for Telephone Service:</strong></p><p>The asset account of cash will go down and the expense account of telephone expense will go up, bringing equity down. Expense accounts can be confusing when considering the effect on the accounting equation because expense accounts are temporary accounts and are part of the equity section of the accounting equation. Expenses represent the consumption of assets or the incursion of liabilities to help generate revenue. Assets consumed or liabilities incurred to help generate revenue will bring down equity, equity calculated as assets minus liabilities.</p><p><strong>Completed Work on Account \u2013 No cash received:</strong></p><p>If no cash is effected, we will consider what was received, that being an \u201cI owe you\u201d from a customer in this case. An asset of an \u201cI owe you\u201d from a customer seems strange at first, a promised payment not being tangible, but a promise to pay does have value even though there is a chance it will not ever be received. Accounts receivable is the account representing an \u201cI owe you\u201d from customers, an asset account showing value due for work done.</p><p>The asset of accounts receivable will go up, and revenue or income will go up, increasing the equity section of the accounting equation. Revenue is a temporary account representing income that has been earned, and temporary accounts are part of the equity section.</p><p><strong>Payment for Amount Owed for Past Transaction:</strong></p><p>Cash will go down, and liabilities will go down. Paying cash for a transaction that happened in the past, for value received in the past, means we are paying off a liability, like paying off a credit card. Accounts payable is the most common liability account for most companies, representing what is owed to third-party vendors. When we pay off a balance that is due the liability account of accounts payable will go down.</p><p>Financial statements are the end goal of financial accounting, the final product most useful to external users like investors, creditors, and customers. Financial statements include the balance sheet, the income statement, the statement of equity, and the statement of cash flows. We will concentrate on the first three statements here and move to the statement of cash flows later.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",

            "description": "<p>When I was younger and decided to become a filmmaker I decided to come to London and study film at the university. Six months into my course I quit university when I realized that the information provided there was not sufficient for me to make a film. I was young, broke, and all I had was a dream, all I needed was the information and guidance.</p><p>As times changed, I had to adapt to constantly changing technology. I learned a lot about filmmaking from the Internet, but there was one thing that I couldn't find online, and that is how to actually make my own film. A real film, a feature film. A film that I can share with the whole world. A film that I can watch on TV. I needed to find a way to make a film without relying on people donating their money for my film or without hurting friends and family by asking them to help me make my film.</p><p>So that's what I did. I rolled my sleeves and jumped into self-education. As years went on I made mistakes, I improved, and I learned from my own failures. And this is what this course is all about. I know how important and how hard it is to make a feature film, but don't feel down. Let's make your movie and share it with the world.</p>",

            "description": "<p><strong><em>2022 is the Ideal year to launch your online business and earn money online</em></strong>. Many people lost their jobs during the pandemic, so now is the ideal time to create a business online and generate income by self-publishing low content books on Amazon KDP (kindle direct publishing)!</p><p><br></p><p>In late 2021, I started my <strong>Amazon KDP</strong> business, and I could see the tremendous opportunity of this business. <strong><em>Fast Forward</em></strong> 6 Months, and I've now sold over <strong>10000 </strong>Low Content Books on Amazon KDP, generating a passive income of over $1600 per month.</p><p><br></p><p>The low content Books that I published in the first few months of 2021 still bring me a daily income that ranges from $10 to 50 dollars a day.</p><p><br></p><p>The best part about self-publishing low content books on amazon is that I haven't modified these books for nearly 6 months now! These low-content paperback books will continue generating passive income in future years!</p><p><br></p><p>I started my pro career as an industrial engineer. But I always kept my dream of creating and conducting my own online business.</p><p><br></p><p>It took me many years to discover exactly what it was. At this moment, I couldn't be more satisfied working online from any area around the world.</p><p><br></p><p>I can gladly say that I'm doing what I am devoted to. The favorable effect you can have by designing and publishing gift books, teaching resources, daily journals, etc., is a great way to be inspired each day you publish on Amazon KDP.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Self publishing on Amazon KDP is a profitable business model</strong>?</p><p><br></p><p>Firstly, there is no obstacle to launching an amazon KDP business.

Amazon does all the heavy lifting for you, from Printing the book to Distribution, Customer support, and Processing payments and refunds.</p><p><br></p><p>As the author and publisher of low-content books, you receive a royalty payment from amazon as soon as your book sells on the KDP platform.</p><p><br></p><p>You no longer have to pile stacks of pre-printed books, expecting any future sales. Amazon KDP is a Print on Demand business model (POD).</p><p><br></p><p>Your low content book will only be printed and distributed by Amazon once a customer orders from Amazon through their online platform. As soon as the customer orders the book, Amazon takes care of all the rest for you!</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why should I choose KDP Publishing over other online alternatives?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Self-publishing on Amazon KDP is one of the few online business models that require no budget (You can start with a zero-dollar budget).</p><p><br></p><p>The advantage of KDP is that \"Amazon\" the world's largest distributor of books, takes care of everything for you.</p><p><br></p><p>You also have total control over the design and book settings before you decide to publish, and without needing outside experts to outsource design and publishing skills.</p><p><br></p><p>Same as with print on demand, Amazon takes excellent care of handling customer service for you. This is why starting a KDP business is the perfect passive income money-generating asset.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Why Choose This Course?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Start Your KDP Journey Now! </strong>I was able to turn my online KDP publishing business into a highly profitable business in lesser than a year. With the sharp rise in online shopping, there is no better time than <strong><em>NOW</em></strong> to launch your <strong>KDP Publishing</strong> online business, and to start earning long-term passive income.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>You can start with a zero-dollar budget</strong>. I started with ZERO $, and I will share how you can do the same during the course.</p><p> If you have around $10, you can get started even quicker. Better yet If you have $50, you can quickly see many sales on this Amazon business.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How much time does it take to start getting sales? </strong>Once you have books published on the Amazon store, they will start to earn you royalties for years to come. The number of books and how much you make from this will rely on your time and effort. Expect to start noticing sales after a few weeks, however.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Don't you need any design or writing skills? </strong>If you don't have design skills, rest assured that you don't have to. I will show you how to create and design low-content book covers and interiors without having to write a single piece of text.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>I promise not to waste time</strong> with tactics that won't make you money inside the course\u2014Facebook ads, blogs, websites, weird traffic sources, or spending money for reviews. I will show you that you can make money publishing low-content paperback books without investing money on marketing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Will I only be selling low-content books? And what are low-content books anyways? </strong>Low content books are books with no content, such as notebooks, journals, logbooks, drawing scrapbooks, composition notebooks, and Learn to Write practice books. Etc. These are super easy to make and can increase your income agreeably.</p><p><br></p><p>Low and No Content books require little or no writing at all.</p><p>In this course, I even show you a way to download Free interiors without having to design or create them yourself.</p><p><br></p><p>Once completed and published on KDP, these books will sell every day across online book marketplaces, including the United States, UK, Australia, France, Canada, Germany, etc...</p>",

Student\u2019s questioning the relevance of what they are learning causes students to lose interest. A loss of student interest causes students grades to fall.</p><p>Part of the reason accounting textbooks have a difficult time incorporating the current topic into the big picture is that a textbook is restricted by what can fit on a page and the problems a textbook provides are restricted by what a student can accomplish with paper and pencil.<br></p><p>The use of instructional video providing a step by step process along with Excel that allows students to sum up large columns of numbers in a short time provides the tools to create a comprehensive problem that will demonstrate current topics in the context of the entire accounting process.</p><p><strong>Why Take This Course?</strong></p><p>We will learn the accounting cycle in a comprehensive way and learn the fundamental of Excel.</p><p>Learning the accounting process without Excel or Excel without accounting is a waste of time and not an efficient way to learn either topic.</p><p>Like assets being equivalent to liabilities and equity, accounting is equivalent to Excel in many ways and therefore learning Excel will accelerate our learning of accounting and make what we learn more applicable.</p><p>Accounting is also the perfect tool to learn Excel. This course will not provide a broad overview of everything Excel can do because that is not a way to learn. Courses attempting to demonstrate all the functions Excel fail to create value for learners because learners will not retain what they learn without a foundation of core concepts and a reason for learning each new function.</p><p>This course will cover the fundamentals of Excel, those components used 99% of the time, and the components needed as a foundation for learning more about Excel.</p><p>The core components of Excel we will learn include adding, subtracting, and summing up columns of numbers.</p><p>We will learn the core concept of Excel through demonstration, repetition, and application to practical problems.</p><p><strong>What Will Be Included in This Course?</strong></p><p>We will complete a comprehensive problem using both instructional video and application.</p><p>Although the course offers much more than just instructional video, it does include over 20 hours of instructional video.</p><p>We also include an Excel worksheet with just about every presentation allowing us to both see the completed answer and work through the problems step by step along with the video.</p><p>Each Excel workbook includes at least two tabs. One tab will have the answer so that we can see how the completed worksheet is constructed and the second tab will provide us the opportunity to enter the data along with the instructional video.</p><p><strong>Who Will We Be Learning From?</strong></p><p>We will be learning from somebody who has practical accounting experience as a practicing CPA, teaching experience, curriculum design experience.</p><p>Credentials include:</p><p>We are learning from someone who has both instruction and curriculum development experience needed to construct comprehensive courses of a technical nature in a way that meets students\u2019 needs and expectations.</p><p><strong>\u00a0What Will We Learn?</strong></p><p>We will learn how to complete the components of the accounting cycle and the fundamental of Excel including addition, subtraction, and the sum function.</p><p>Below is a short list of what is included in the accounting cycle and what we will cover in the course:</p><ul><li>Journalizing journal entries</li><li>Posting to the general ledger</li><li>Create a trial balance</li><li>Adjusting entries</li><li>Bank reconciliations</li><li>Financial statement generation</li><li>Closing entries</li><li>Reversing entries</li></ul><p><strong>How Will We Be Taught?</strong></p><p>We will learn through viewing and then doing.</p><p>We will demonstrate each component of the problem in small digestible parts using both a completed Excel worksheet and instructional video.</p><p>We will provide an Excel worksheet that can be filled in along with the instructional video or after watching the instructional video.</p><p><strong>Please join us in learning Accounting, Excel, debits, and credits.</strong></p><p><strong>It will be Great\u00a0</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Course Content Includes:</strong></p><ul><li>Start a New Business Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Set up New Company Worksheet</li><li>10 Set Up Inventory Items</li><li>15 Set Up Customer Balances</li><li>20 Set Up Vendors Beginning Balances</li><li>25 Enter Opening Account Balances</li><li>Accounting Concepts Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>135 Cash Method vs Accrual Method</li><li>132 Balance Sheet &amp; Income Statement Relationship</li><li>155 Financial Transaction Rules</li><li>160 Financial Transaction Thought Process</li><li>Enter Data for First Month Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Owner Deposit &amp; Loan Deposit</li><li>10 Purchase Furniture &amp; Record Investment</li><li>20 Part 1 Invoice Transaction</li><li>20 Part Two Create on Invoice Transaction</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 1</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 2</li><li>25 Receive Payment Part 3</li><li>30 Cash Sales Transaction Part 1</li><li>30 Cash Sales Part 2</li><li>35 Deposit Part 1</li><li>35 Deposit Part 2</li><li>40 Part 1 Inventory Payment</li><li>40 Part 2 Inventory Payment</li><li>45 Invoice for Preordered Item Part 1.</li><li>45 Invoice for Pre-ordered Item Part 2</li><li>50 Receive Payment &amp; Make Deposit</li><li>55 Part 1 Write Check</li><li>55 Part 2 Write Check Part 2</li><li>60 Pay Bills</li><li>65 Customer Jobs</li><li>70 Payroll</li><li>75 Job Sales Receipt</li><li>80 Financial Statements &amp; Reports</li><li>90 Closing Process January</li><li>92 Worksheet Month Two</li><li>Enter Data for Second Month Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>05 Make Loan Payments</li><li>10 Short Term Investment</li><li>20 Receive Inventory With Bill</li><li>20 Receive Inventory With Bill Part 2</li><li>25 Sales Receipt &amp; Deposit</li><li>25 Part 2 Sales Receipt &amp; Deposit</li><li>30 Advanced Payment From Customer</li><li>35 Apply Credit to Invoice</li><li>40 Record Sales on Account</li><li>45 Advance Customer Payment</li><li>50 Bills Track &amp; Pay</li><li>55 Customer Payment on Account</li><li>60 Pay Sales Tax</li><li>65 Pay Payroll Tax</li><li>70 Enter Bills &amp; Pay Bills</li><li>75 Service Item &amp; Invoices</li><li>77 Purchase Equipment with Debt</li><li>80 Payroll</li><li>90 Rental Income</li><li>95 Financial Statements</li><li>Bank Reconciliations Section of Accounting &amp; Excel Course</li><li>10 Bank Reconciliation January</li><li>12 Bank Reconciliation Adjusting Entries January</li><li>15 Bank Reconciliation February</li><li>20 Bank Reconciliation Feb.

            "description": "<p>Virality is not a single attribute. It's a rule of architecture. It's not a fortunate outcome. It's sophisticated. It's art too. People are the key component of all practices in social media. That means the sort of real social buzz that can bring your content in front of a massive amount of real people is not an automated process. Although attempts to automate social buzz are nothing more than ineffective spam, there is now a real solution to the good news. First, hear me out.</p><p><strong><em>When was the last time you created anything viral online?</em></strong></p><p>Whether you're new to content marketing or are a viral content maven, you probably know that it can be nearly impossible to predict which tweet or video, or meme might go viral. It often seems like virality is entirely natural.</p><p><strong><em>But, Are You Now Ready to Watch Your Blog Posts or&nbsp;Videos Go Viral on Social Media?&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Join this third elective course (RoboAuthor 10.0)&nbsp;as part of the RoboAuthor series that talks about amazing strategies related to the most powerful viral marketing tool called \"Viral Content Buzz\".</p><p><strong>What do you mean by viral content?</strong></p><p>Viral content is material, such as a post, image, or video that easily spreads online through links to websites and social networking. A classic example of viral content, the internet meme typically takes the form of a video or image of one or two lines of text. However, it is possible to spread virally any type of online content that appeals to users enough to make them want to share it. <strong>Videos go viral</strong> because they connect with their audience and engage or wow them to the maximum potential.</p><p>The notion of viral content has two interdependent sides. <strong><em>When a piece of content excites the viewers on the human side, it induces an emotional response to the point that they can't help but share it. It's \"remarkable\" stuff, in other words.</em></strong></p><p>We all have opinions about what content styles go viral: a soundless social video, a data-backed explainer, a timed newsjack. But it ultimately comes down to feeling, no matter the format. Does the story make you feel furious, inspired, comprehended? You have to ask with everything you create: would I care if this scrolled through on my newsfeed?</p><p>For various reasons, content goes viral. Keep that in mind. Entertainment value is a common feature; other features include usefulness, information, artistic merit, the promotion of points of view, and the value of shock.&nbsp; Another viral content driver is the audience and reputation of the sharer. Social influencers have built an online presence on social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn,&nbsp;Pinterest, and Quora across multiple channels and large follow-ups are present in those streams.</p><p>Going viral is a hard thing to do when it comes to advertising content. What will spark a post to make it go viral is not always obvious. Evidence suggests that content is not plain, but amplification. Sharing with just five influencers can be enough in our research to ignite the material. Paid amplification, if you have a potential viral post, can also help kick things off.</p><p>After having understood how ViralContentBuzz works and having done much research on the tool, I present to you an incredible course that can help you understand how ViralContentBuzz works when it comes to increasing and boosting traffic to your website/blog.&nbsp;This is going to solve all your problems of going viral using content on social media, forever.</p><p>As per different case studies put together by different people, these tips taught in this mind-blowing course are killer tactics that will get&nbsp;your articles shared by social media influencers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About Viral Content Buzz/Bee</strong></p><p>ViralContentBee (formerly ViralContentBuzz)&nbsp;is a web-based social media marketing portal or platform that leverages a crowd-sourcing model to facilitate the generation of REAL \u201csocial buzz\u201d on high-quality content. The portal allows you to get Facebook Shares, Pinterest Pins, StumbleUpon (Now known as Mix) likes YouTube views, and Tweets from established social media accounts that are primarily outside of your normal social media marketing channels. This keeps the social media sharing organic and gives your content REAL social media signals! Not only does Google love these types of signals, but it also means more eyeballs on your content (hence more traffic and better branding!</p><p>With Viral Content Bee, one can generate high-quality traffic with free social media promotion!&nbsp;Social media enthusiasts can now increase their blog or video traffic by 200% by putting their content in front of eager social media influencers, worldwide.</p><p>If you are looking to skyrocket your blog traffic in this competitive world and want to learn the trick behind all of this in a very short period of time and start experimenting and applying the simple yet effective techniques taught here, then this course is for you.</p><p>So, why are you waiting to go viral?&nbsp;Join now and let's begin the virality. Getting your content marketing to go viral is not an exact science by any means, whatsoever. Learn what they think sets viral content apart from the rest of the crowd.&nbsp;You have the answer here with you.&nbsp;Embrace it. Get ready for this incredible course on virality in 2022. Enrol now and let's start rolling.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Prior to placement, commercial broiler farms should be prepared to receive new chicks. If litter has been recycled, it may be turned, treated, and/or otherwise managed to reduce ammonia, pathogen ,and insect load. Houses will be heated to provide adequate temperature for the chicks and feed and water lines may be primed so that they are at room temperature prior to placement. Temperature maybe uniform within houses or a temperature gradient may be provided to allow chicks to better</p><p>adjust their individual temperatures. If a temperature gradient is provided, feeders and waterers should be placed so that birds can adjust their temperature and still have easily access to feed and water. In general, chicks are placed at a ground temperature of approximately 90-95\u00b0F (32.2-35\u00b0C) and temperature is decreased as the birds age at approximately 5\u00b0F (2.8\u00b0C)/week until the temperature is around 70\u00b0F (21\u00b0C). However, this greatly varies based on the management system and breed of bird so temperature should be adjusted based on flock behavior . Many commercial broiler houses have some or extensive environmental control and the ability to implement standard program flock profiles for temperature and ventilation. Chickens in these environments Temperature &amp; ventilation Uniformity of ventilation is ideal to improve flock performance. Poor ventilation may pro-mote excessive litter moisture and increase the exposure of the chickens to enteric pathogens. Poor ventilation may cause excessive ammonia levels, which could be detrimental to the health and welfare of animals and employees&nbsp; Excessive ammonia at the level of the chicks may be less detectable to a standing human and high levels can cause health problems such as corneal ulceration, conjunctivitis, and inflammation/deciliation of the trachea thereby predisposing birds to respiratory pathogens. Broiler processing Based on market needs, broilers will be processed at a target weight or age determined by the individual company. Loading chickens into transport vehicles to move to processing may be done at night or early morning to decrease physical and heat stress during loading. At the processing plant, misting or fans may help keep birds cool and reduce mortality while birds are waiting to be processed. In colder regions, heating systems may be needed. Handling of birds at processing, including unloading and shackling, should be done in a way to minimize trauma to the birds, which would not only be a welfare concern but would lead to increased condemnations. Birds should be rendered unconscious and/or euthanizedin a manner that does not cause undue stress, increase condemnations, or adversely affect food safety.</p>",

We will build the outline for our accounting system from the blank spreadsheet.</p><p>For each new step in the process, you will have access to a downloadable Excel Workbook, containing at least two tabs, one with the answer, the new steps being completed, the other starting out where the prior presentation left off.</p><p>Therefore, you can complete the entire problem starting from one blank spreadsheet, or you can jump forward in the problem and rework any component of the problem by downloading the related worksheet at that point in the process.</p><p>After constructing the outline of our accounting worksheet, the first section will discuss the most common accounting transactions and the data input form often used in accounting software, like QuickBooks, to enter them, common data input forms including invoice, bill, deposit. . .</p><p>We will then start our comprehensive problem, constructing a new Excel worksheet and entering beginning balances into it, imagining that we had a prior accounting system which we are now converting to our new accounting system in Excel.</p><p>We will then enter two-months worth of data input. When entering the accounting data we will create the journal entry, post it to the trial balance, giving us a good look at which accounts are impacted, post to the general ledger, and make adjustments to any subsidiary ledgers needed. </p><p>We will also update the financial statements periodically.</p><p>For the second month of operations, we create a bit more complex trial balance, allowing us to calculate both the year-to-date numbers, including both months of data input, and the current period numbers, showing income statement accounts for just the second month of operations.</p><p>After entering two months of data input, we will process two bank reconciliations, using mock bank statements. As we construct our bank reconciliations, we will discuss how accounting software often accomplishes this task.</p><p>Next, we will adjust our worksheet to enter period end adjusting journal entries as well as reversing entries. For each adjusting entry we will consider the reasons for it and how to set up the accounting system so that our adjusting entries do not mess up the data input process in the accounting department.</p><p>After entering the adjusting entries we will construct our financial statements.</p>",

It\u2019s a $3 billion global business where the median rate for executive coaches is $500 an hour.</p><p>The news gets even better. You can be a <strong>management coach</strong> from where ever you are. I have worked with clients throughout North America, the UK, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark. So can you. With technologies such as Zoom or Skype, your home office is your gateway to the world. Payments re made electronically, instantly, and easily.</p><p>Your business goals could be the same as mine: I work from where I want, with who I want, when I want, and how I want.</p><p>Leaders want to get better. The competition for great executive positions is getting tighter. Those who have greater insight, knowledge, and information have an important edge over others in their industry.</p><p>To be sure, your clients want to hear about your experiences, your knowledge, your beliefs and get your advice.

You do this by asking really smart, thoughtful, insightful, and challenging questions. I will give you some of the most results oriented questions that I\u2019ve used with my clients. But don\u2019t stop there. After your client answers your question, ask a probing follow up question. Encourage them to go even deeper.</p><p>Are you a business specialist? No problem. Your expertise in HR, technology, marketing, investor relations will serve to help specific clients see what\u2019s possible in their careers.</p><p>Take me for example. I help clients who are smart, talented, and experienced but have a hard time communicating their ideas in certain business situations. That hurts their careers and the company\u2019s bottom line. I give them the communications tools they need and the confidence to succeed.</p><p>General business help in invaluable, too. You see the bigger picture and help your clients make the right moves.</p><p>What about you? We tend to take for granted what we know. Don\u2019t make that assumption. Your knowledge, experience, success, and even your mistakes could prove to be a valuable resource for those that you serve.</p><p>Who are your potential clients? They could be individuals who know they need to get a leg up in order to get to the next step in their careers. You could get a portfolio of corporate clients who know that they have several members of their team who need your services. They may hire you on a monthly retainer basis.</p><p>There is no ceiling for your success as a management coach. Take this <strong>Management Coaching Course</strong> and see what\u2019s possible for you. - Bob Berkowitz</p><p><br></p><p>Here is what Udemy students say about this course:</p><p><strong><em>\"Interesting and insightful course which will stir your creativity, self awareness and self criticism for personal growth.

We plan on updating this course so that you can continue to use it as a reference even as QuickBooks Online evolves its software. We hope this course will be a useful, up-to-date tool you can use, at no added cost, for many years into the future.</p><p>People often have this first question when considering a QuickBooks Online course: How do I access the software? And how can I get access to a file where I can practice data input? In other words, you may have access to a company file through work or from your business, but you would like to have access to a test file so you can practice data input without risking your company data in the process.</p><p><strong>Below are a few options to access QuickBooks Online. We will go over each option in more detail in the course.</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>QuickBooks often offers a free 30-day trial, perfect to practice with</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>They also often offer a student version, which may provide more extended access to the software, and this would be great considering we will be covering a comprehensive problem.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>QuickBooks also provides a free test drive file.</strong></p></li></ul><p>The first part of the course will discuss how to access QuickBooks Online, the accounting software options QuickBooks offers, and set up our QuickBooks file.</p><p>We will then practice navigating the accounting software, the free QuickBooks Online Test Drive File being our primary tool. When first learning QuickBooks, it is best to start with a file that already has data, attempting to deconstruct the data input done in the past, a method similar to an employee starting a new job.</p><p>In other words, when starting a new job, we work with an existing data file rather than setting up a new one. We then attempt to see what has been done in the past so the process can be replicated in future transactions, maintaining consistency.</p><p>In the second half of the course, we will create a new company file, the free 30-day trial file being our primary tool at this point in the class.</p><p>After learning how to deconstruct past financial transactions in the accounting system in the first half of the course, we are ready to build the QuickBooks Online data input from the ground up.</p><p>The comprehensive problem in the second half of the course will cover setting up a new company file, setting the preferences, adding beginning balances, entering two months of data input, completing bank reconciliations, entering adjusting entries, and budgeting.</p><p>We will then have a course section explicitly devoted to bank feeds. We will discuss how bank feeds will fit into different accounting systems, the application of the bank feeds tool differing as company needs differ. For example, the use of bank feeds will vary for a company that uses a cash-based method and a company that uses an accrual method.</p><p>The course will cover the use of bank feed rules and how they are used to automate more of the accounting system.</p><p>We will then have sections of the course that focus on more specialized areas.</p>",

The syntax is simple and the code is very readable. With Python, you can write programs in fewer lines of code than with most other programming languages. The popularity of Python is growing rapidly. It is now one of the most popular programming languages. Python has a wide variety of applications. It is used for automation, web application development, artificial intelligence, data science and so on:</p><p><strong>Automation</strong></p><p>Python can make life easier by automating many tasks, such as scraping a website to collect data, automating test cases in software development, or automating everyday office tasks. Python can easily access and read all kinds of files, which opens up the possibility of saving a lot of time by automating repetitive tasks.</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>Python is a good choice for rapid web application development. With many frameworks like Django, Pyramid, and Flask, you can develop web applications with great speed using Python. Python is used on the server side of web development. You can use Python to interact with database and create RESTful API services.</p><p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p><p>The near future will be the era of artificial intelligence. In the past, computers and machines were used to perform mathematical calculations at very high speeds, but now many large organizations and researchers are working to develop intelligent systems that can perform tasks like a human. To some extent, machines are able to understand human emotions and their natural language. They can mimic certain human actions that were not possible before. Again, Python is very popular for developing AI systems.</p><p><strong>Data Science</strong></p><p>Earlier, Python was mainly used to build applications and write scripts to automate tasks, but now a brand new trend of data science has given Python an even bigger boost. Data scientists are heavily dependent on Python because it is so simple, has a large community, and can perform huge calculations with ease.<br><br>Python is being used in a wide variety of fields, and there are no signs that this trend is coming to a halt. It's safe to say that Python is here to stay for the long haul in this ever-changing and evolving IT industry.</p>",
